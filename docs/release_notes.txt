-- ABOUT -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 LiteStep is a replacement shell for the standard Windows® Explorer shell.

 The Explorer shell provides the familiar desktop environment, start menu, and
 task bar.  The developers of LiteStep (and thousands of users) have found the
 Explorer shell to be static, cumbersome and otherwise too ugly to use.  Thus
 exists LiteStep.

 LiteStep replaces that environment in just about any way that you might find
 useful (and eye catching).  LiteStep provides the way to make your desktop
 interface unique, enjoyable and dynamic.  The desktop environments that the
 LiteStep users create range from a blank screen full of functionality based on
 hotkeys and hotspots, to eye pleasing morphing menus and sliding toolbars
 filled with graphical and informative displays of system status, the latest
 news headlines and the current weather report.

-- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ---------------------------------------------------------

 LiteStep requires only that you are running a 32bit version of Windows:

  Windows 95, Windows 98(se), Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP

 NOTE: Windows Vista 32bit is currently *NOT* supported!

 LiteStep is designed to consume less resources than the Explorer shell which it
 replaces; so there are no system requirements above and beyond that which is
 needed for a normal Windows-based system.

 However, depending on what modules (add-ons) are loaded, any given desktop
 environment will have its own system requirements.  This may range from being
 only compatible with Win2K/XP or requiring a 3d accelerated graphics card.  Be
 sure to read the accompanying documentation for any theme or module that you
 choose to install.

-- INSTALL ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 NOTE:
 -----
 You are about to install a replacement shell for Windows.  A shell is not a
 normal application; it runs as a special system process.  Replacing the shell
 is not a supported procedure by Microsoft®, and as such, it is possible that if
 you do something wrong, you may end up with a non functional desktop and/ or
 your system may display an erroneous error message asking you to re-install
 Windows.  Do NOT panic, a very simple solution will put you back to where you
 need to be, so that you can fix whatever mistake you made, and try again.
 Please read the documentation on this topic that came with your LiteStep
 distribution, or review the "Manual Install" steps below.

 Now that you are ready to get going, there are a couple of methods to start
 using LiteStep.

 You MUST have administrative access to install LiteStep.

 A) LiteStep Distributions (Recommended and automated)
 -----------------------------------------------------

 The recommended way to start with LiteStep is to install one of the community
 driven LiteStep distributions.  Typically these distributions come with a
 friendly step by step installation wizard that will set your system up using a
 default desktop environment and theme.  Currently we recommend using one of the
 following two distributions which implement the Open Theme Standard 2 (OTS2).

 Traditionally Omar's LiteStep Installer has been widely accepted and used.
 However, Omar has long abandoned his distribution, and as such it has fallen
 out of date.  It no longer contains the most recent version of LiteStep or
 modules; thus requiring manual updates to the distribution after installation.
 Because of this another installation project has been started; the LiteStep
 Open Source Installer (LOSI) is fully up to date with the latest LiteStep and
 module releases.  However, LOSI yet lacks proper documentation and has not
 undergone as thorough of testing where-as Omar's installer and default theme is
 well documented and has been successfully used for the last several years.

 Omar's LiteStep Installer may be downloaded from:

 http://www.beyondconvention.com/ohussain/lsinstaller/

 LOSI may be downloaded from:

 http://www.tlundberg.com/LOSI/

 Regardless of which distribution you use, you will find plenty of help on the
 LiteStep Mailing List (LSML) and user forums on one of the community websites.
 Please join us in our IRC channel #litestep on Freenode (irc.freenode.net) if
 you have any immediate support need.  However, be patient when asking a
 question as IRC is renown for being full of idlers.

 B) LiteStep From Scratch (Manual install and configuration)
 -----------------------------------------------------------

 STOP: If you are NOT highly familiar with editing the registry or reading
       lots of documentation and editing text configuration files, then this
       procedure is NOT for you!  Please use a LiteStep Distribution. Thank you.

 For the do-it-yourself type, please thoroughly read the following before
 proceeding.  It will save you a lot of headache.  I promise.

 Create a folder for LiteStep.  Generally this is done at "C:\LiteStep".

 Extract the contents of "LS-0.24.8.zip" to this folder.  Once the contents are
 extracted, there should be a file located at "C:\LiteStep\litestep.exe".

 Create a text file named "step.rc" and place it in the same folder as
 "litestep.exe".  Using the previous example location, this empty text file
 should now be at "C:\LiteStep\step.rc".

 Next, consult the section "USAGE (HELP)" to configure LiteStep via the step.rc
 text file (A sample step.rc is provided in that section).  Do NOT set LiteStep
 as your shell until you have configured it, otherwise you will be left with a
 dysfunctional (yet recoverable) system.

 To set LiteStep as your shell, follow these instructions:

  1. Win9x/ME

    - Using a text editor (e.g. Notepad) open the Windows System file named
      "system.ini".  This file's location is normally "C:\Windows\system.ini"

    - Locate the line that begins with "shell=".  This line is located in the
      "[boot]" section.  Typically the full line looks like "shell=explorer.exe"
      (without quotation marks).  Comment out this line (which disables it) by
      placing a semi-colon at the beginning of the line.  The line should now
      look like ";shell=explorer.exe" (without the quotation marks).

    - Create a new "shell=" line in the same location as the one removed.  This
      new line should contain the location of "litestep.exe".  For example it
      might look like "shell=C:\LiteStep\litestep.exe" (without the quotation
      marks).

    - Reboot your system.

    - README! When you reboot, if you get the error:

      "CANNOT FIND <shell file name> PLEASE REINSTALL WINDOWS"

      Do NOT reinstall windows!  Just simply follow the instructions below to
      put your shell back to the default:

      Boot into DOS (press F8 before Windows starts, or use a DOS boot disk).
      Issue the command "edit C:\Windows\system.ini" adjusting for the location
      of your system.ini file.  Delete the new line you created in the previous
      steps, and uncomment the line you previously disabled.  Do this by
      deleting the semicolon at the start of the line.  You should now have one
      line that starts with "shell=" in the "[boot]" section of the "system.ini"
      file, "shell=explorer.exe".  Save the file and reboot your system.

  2. Win2K/XP

    - Note: Please see the LiteStep Wiki for a "Group Policy" installation.

    - Note: If you are NOT an administrator, you will most likely NOT be able to
      set LiteStep as your shell.  The only exception to this is if your System
      Administrator has enabled "per user" shells.  This is highly unlikely.

      While it is "possible" to run LiteStep at the same time as the default
      Explorer shell, it is discouraged and completely unsupported.  Good luck!

    - Open "regedit" or a similar utility.

    - To ENABLE "per user" shells:
      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
          \IniFileMapping\system.ini\boot

      * Change the string value named "Shell" to:

        USR:Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

    - To DISABLE "per user" shells:
      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
          \IniFileMapping\system.ini\boot

      * Change the string value named "Shell" to:

        SYS:Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

    - To set the DEFAULT system shell:
      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

      * Change the string value named "Shell" to the location of the file you
        want to use as your default system shell.

        For LiteStep use (adjust path as necessary):

          C:\LiteStep\litestep.exe

        For Explorer use (do not specify a path):

          Explorer.exe

    - To set the shell for the currently logged in user:
      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

      * Change (create) the string value named "Shell" to the location of the
        file you want to use as your current user shell.

        For LiteStep use (adjust path as necessary):

          C:\LiteStep\litestep.exe

        For Explorer use (do not specify a path):

          Explorer.exe

    - To use any shell besides Explorer, the following key MUST be changed.
      If you do not configure this key, you will not be able to use the
      Explorer File Manager.

      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer

      * Change (create) the DWORD value named "DesktopProcess" to a value of 1.

    - If you changed the "per user" shell setting, you MUST reboot.  Otherwise
      simply log off.  When you return to the desktop, LiteStep will be running
      as your shell if you managed to configure everything correctly.

    - If you end up with a blank or otherwise non-functional desktop.  Press
      CTRL+SHIFT+ESC key combination.  The Windows Task Manager will open.  Use
      the File menu to Run a New Task.  Launch your registry editor and use the
      previous instructions to set your system shell back to the default
      Explorer shell.

-- USAGE (HELP) ----------------------------------------------------------------

 The following section lays out the structure of LiteStep, and the available
 configuration options.  When used within this document to describe a parameter
 value, <> means a required parameter, and {} means an optional parameter.

 A) LiteStep Structure
 ---------------------

 LiteStep is designed around a modular plugin system.  The LiteStep "core" by
 itself is rather useless to you until you configure and load a plugin.  These
 plugins are called "Modules" and are available from several LiteStep community
 websites (See the ABOUT section).

 The LiteStep core consists of:
  - litestep.exe     Main executable.  Loads modules, handles window messages
                     communication.  Runs startup apps, includes DDE and tray
                     services.

  - lsapi.dll        LiteStep API for modules to use.  Loads and parses step.rc;
                     handles $evars$ and all other configuration.  Manages !bang
                     commands, includes core !bangs.

  - hook.dll         The system shell hook used by some legacy LiteStep modules
                     for receiving global system messages.

 LiteStep also depends on "libpng13.dll" and "zlib1.dll" for Portable Network
 Graphics (PNG) image support.  Those two files must exist in the same directory
 as "litestep.exe" or in the system path.

 LiteStep uses a text configuration file named "step.rc" which must exist in the
 same directory as "litestep.exe".

 LiteStep loads Modules which use the LiteStep API "lsapi.dll" to read their
 configuration values, create advanced graphical displays and interact with the
 LiteStep core to provide you with a highly functional and eye-caching desktop.

 B) Command Line Parameters
 --------------------------

 "litestep.exe" has several command line switches to perform various actions.

  -nostartup
  ----------
   Disables running Windows startup items when loading LiteStep.

   This is useful on Windows 95, Windows 98(se) and Windows ME if you need to
   restart LiteStep.

   On Windows 2000 and Windows XP this switch is not needed as startup items are
   ran only once per session.

   Usage:
    litestep.exe -nostartup

  -startup
  --------
   Force running Windows startup items when loading LiteStep.

   On Windows 2000 and Windows XP, startup items are run only once per session.
   Using this switch overrides that behavior and forces startup item execution.

   This is not useful on Windows 95/98(se)/ME as startup items are always ran.

   Usage:
    litestep.exe -startup

  !<bang command>
  ---------------
   Passes the specified !bang command and parameters to a currently running
   instance of LiteStep.  The previous instance of LiteStep receiving the !bang
   command executes the specified !bang command.

   This is useful for external control of LiteStep, perhaps from a script.

   Usage:
    litestep.exe !recycle
    litestep.exe !ReloadModule "C:\LiteStep\modules\popup.dll"

  <file>
  ------
   Specifies the absolute path of the "step.rc" configuration file LiteStep
   should read its directives from.  This overrides the default of using the
   step.rc file located in the same folder as litestep.exe.

   Usage:
    litestep.exe C:\LiteStep\step.rc

 C) Step.rc Syntax
 -----------------

 The step.rc is formatted in a <command> {value} directive syntax.

  - There may be one directive per textual line.

  - <command> must not be quoted, bracketed or in any other way use the reserved
    characters of the step.rc parsers except in the special case of * character.

  - {value} is dependant per <command> directive and is explained in each
    directive's documentation.  If the directive is required by a Module, please
    read the corresponding documentation provided with the Module.

 LiteStep employs three levels of parsing to step.rc at load-time and expands
 variable references at runtime.

  1. Step.rc File Parser

    - The step.rc File Parser reserves "'[]; as special characters.

      ;  Used at the beginning of a textual line to delineate a comment.
         Comments are lines that are ignored by the Directive Parser.  A comment
         may also exist at the end of a <command> directive.  Everything after
         (and including) the semicolon is ignored.

      See "Step.rc Directive Parser" for other special character descriptions.

    - The File Parser behaves similarly to a pre-processor.  The File Parser is
      the first to touch the step.rc.

    - The step.rc File Parser evaluates the following Directives:

      Include
      If
      ElseIf
      Else
      Endif

  2. Step.rc Directive Parser

    - The step.rc Directive Parser reserves *$"'[] as special characters.

      *  Used at the beginning of a <command> directive to delineate the ability
         to specify multiple <command>s of the same name (one per line).

      $$ Used as a set around a {value} parameter to delineate that a variable
         expansion should occur for that parameter.

      [] Used as a set around a {value} parameter to delineate that the contents
         are a single token value.

      "" Used as a set around a {value} parameter to delineate that any enclosed
         whitespace is part of the value (whitespace is TABs and SPACEs).

      '' Used as a set within the {value} parameter to delineate that the
         enclosed contents are a sub value.

    - The step.rc Directive Parser recognizes several {value} types.

      Boolean => TRUE or FALSE
      Color   => Hexidecimal RGB color value, or RGB decimal triplet
      Integer => Any real Integer value
      Line    => Unparsed literal text
      String  => Whitespace delimited string

  3. Step.rc Evaluation Parser

    - The step.rc Evaluation Parser reserves =<>() as special characters and
      several key words.

      Relational
      ----------
      =      Equal
      <>     Not Equal
      <      Less Than
      <=     Less Than or Equal To
      >      Greater Than
      >=     Greater Than or Equal To

      Grouping
      --------
      (      Open Parenthesis
      )      Close Parenthesis

      Logical
      -------
      and    Both
      or     Either
      not    Negate
      true   Not False
      false  Not True

  4. Runtime Variable Expansion

    - Variable expansion supports textual replacements and math integer
      evaluation when enclosed within a set of $ characters.
      (e.g. $LitestepDir$ or $ScreenWidth - 32$)

      Math
      ----
      +      Addition
      -      Subtraction
      *      Multiplication
      /      Division

      Grouping
      --------
      (      Open Parenthesis
      )      Close Parenthesis


 D) Step.rc Directives
 ---------------------

  Include <file>
  --------------
   Specifies an additional step.rc format file to include.

   Usage:
    Include C:\LiteStep\config\theme.rc

  If, ElseIf, Else, and EndIf
  ---------------------------
   Conditionally parse a section of the step.rc.

   The If directive marks the start of a conditional section.  The If directive
   evaluates an expression to produce a true (nonzero) or false (zero) result.
   If the result is true then the lines following up to the next ElseIf, Else,
   or EndIf are parsed, otherwise they are ignored.

   The ElseIf directive behaves like an If, but the expression is evaluated only
   if all of the previous If and ElseIf expressions have evaluated to false.

   The Else directive parses the lines that follow it only if all the previous
   If and Elseif expressions have evaluated to false.  There may be at most one
   Else and it must follow any ElseIf statements.

   The EndIf directive marks the end of a conditional section.  Each If
   directive must have a corresponding EndIf.  If-EndIf blocks may be nested to
   any depth.

   The expressions that If and ElseIf evaluate can use the following operators,
   listed in order from highest precedence to lowest:

     Parentheses:  ( )
           Unary:  not
      Relational:  = < <= <> > >=
     Logical AND:  and
      Logical OR:  or

   Expressions may also contain Boolean and Integer constants and references to
   LiteStep variables (e-vars).  Do not enclose variables references in dollar
   signs ($) when they occur in conditional expressions.  Strings are not
   supported in expressions (neither string constants nor string variables) in
   0.24.7.

   Usage:
    If <expression>
     <lines>
    ElseIf <expression>
     <lines>
    Else
     <lines>
    EndIf

  LoadModule <file>
  -----------------
   Specifies a Module (plugin) to load.

   Usage:
    LoadModule C:\LiteStep\modules\popup.dll

  LSNoStartup <boolean>
  ---------------------
   Disables running of system Startup items.

   Note: LiteStep must be restarted for this setting to take affect.

   Usage:
    LSNoStartup TRUE

  LSAutoHideModules <boolean>
  ---------------------------
   Automatically hides all LiteStep modules from the display when an application
   enters Full Screen mode. (e.g. A full screen game)

   Usage:
    LSAutoHideModules TRUE

  LSNoShellWarning <boolean>
  --------------------------
   Disables the warning issued when loading LiteStep if another shell is already
   running.  Do not use this setting unless you know what you are doing!

   Note: LiteStep must be restarted for this setting to take affect.

   Usage:
    LSNoShellWarning TRUE

  LSSetAsShell <boolean>
  ----------------------
   Registers LiteStep as the system shell on load.  This will enable an
   automatic re-spawn of LiteStep if LiteStep exits inadvertently.  However,
   this feature is experimental and not recommended at this time.  If you
   experience problem using Explorer as your file manager, try disabling this
   setting.

   Note: LiteStep must be restarted for this setting to take affect.

   Usage:
    LSSetAsShell TRUE

  LSUseSystemDDE <boolean>
  ------------------------
   Enables Dynamic Data Exchange under LiteStep.  This is required to enable
   many features of the Explorer file manager and other system services.
   However its functionality is not fully developed at this time and
   irregularities may exist.  If you experience resource usage troubles, try
   disabling this setting.

   Note: LiteStep must be restarted for this setting to take affect.

   Usage:
    LSUseSystemDDE TRUE

  LSDisableTrayService <boolean>
  ------------------------------
   Disables the Icon Notification (Systray) service.  This is useful if you have
   to run LiteStep on top of another shell, or if you have another application
   implementing the service.

   Note: LiteStep must be restarted for this setting to take affect.

   Usage:
    LSDisableTrayService TRUE

  LSImageFolder <path>
  --------------------
   Sets the default folder that LiteStep looks in when loading images.  This
   will default to <install path>\images\ (e.g. C:\LiteStep\images\).

   Usage:
    LSImageFolder "C:\LiteStep\themes\mytheme\images\"

  ThemeAuthor <string>
  --------------------
   Sets the name of the Author of the current Theme and is displayed in the
   !About box dialog.

   Usage:
    ThemeAuthor "Mr. ThemeWizard"

  ThemeName <string>
  ------------------
   Sets the name of the current Theme and is displayed in the !About box dialog.

 G) Sample Step.rc
 -----------------

 STOP: Copying and pasting the following to your step.rc will *NOT* give you a
       working LiteStep installation.  You will first need to download the
       relevant modules and extract them to your LiteStep folder.

 NOTE: The step.rc contents is what exists between {BeginStepRC} and {EndStepRC}
       not including those two delimiters.

{BeginStepRC}
; This is an EXAMPLE step.rc file.  This example will NOT work without
; downloading the necessary modules (plugins) and placing them in the
; same folder as litestep.exe.

; Next, we need to load the modules (plugins) that we want to use.
; You may download these modules from:
;  http://www.shellfront.org/modules-list.php
; Extract these modules into your LiteStep folder.
LoadModule $LiteStepDir$hotkey.dll    ; hotkey-2.0.zip
LoadModule $LiteStepDir$popup2.dll    ; popup2-2.1.5.zip

; Configure a Hotkey combination to launch Notepad and open this
; step.rc configuration file.
*Hotkey WIN+CTRL   S   notepad.exe "$LiteStepDir$step.rc"

; Configure a Hotkey to recycle (restart) LiteStep.  This will reload
; this step.rc configuration file with any changes, and reload all modules.
*Hotkey WIN+CTRL   R   !recycle

; Configure a Hotkey to open an explorer window and quit LiteStep.
*Hotkey WIN+CTRL   Q   !execute [explorer.exe /e,/root,,$Drives$][!quit]

; Configure a Hotkey to display LiteStep's "About" dialog.
*Hotkey WIN+CTRL   A   !about

; Configure a few default hotkeys that emulate Explorer's functionality
*Hotkey WIN        C   explorer.exe /root,,$Controls$
*Hotkey WIN        E   explorer.exe /e,/root,,$Drives$
*Hotkey WIN        L   !logoff
*Hotkey WIN        M   !MinimizeWindows
*Hotkey WIN+SHIFT  M   !RestoreWindows
*Hotkey WIN        R   !run

; NOTE: pressing CTRL+ESC or the Windows Key will display the Popup Menu.
; The Hotkey module automatically configures those hotkeys by default.

; Next, we will configure a basic Popup Menu.
HotlistName "LiteStep 0.24.8"

PopupMinWidth 125
PopupMaxWidth 300
PopupNoBevel

*Popup "My Computer" !PopupMyComputer
