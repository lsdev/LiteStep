-- ABOUT -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 LiteStep is a replacement shell for the standard Windows® Explorer shell.

 The Explorer shell provides the familiar desktop environment, start menu, and
 task bar.  The developers of LiteStep (and thousands of users) have found the
 Explorer shell to be static, cumbersome and otherwise too ugly to use.  Thus
 exists LiteStep.

 LiteStep replaces that environment in just about any way that you might find
 useful (and eye catching).  LiteStep provides the way to make your desktop
 interface unique, enjoyable and dynamic.  The desktop environments that the
 LiteStep users create range from a blank screen full of functionality based on
 hotkeys and hotspots, to eye pleasing morphing menus and sliding toolbars
 filled with graphical and informative displays of system status, the latest
 news headlines and the current weather report.

-- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ---------------------------------------------------------

 LiteStep requires only that you are running a 32bit version of Windows:

  Windows 95, Windows 98(se), Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003

 NOTE: Windows Vista/2008 32bit versions are *NOT* supported in 0.24.8!  Please
       check our website for experimental builds containing support for running
       under both 32bit and 64bit Windows XP/Vista/2008/Win7 versions.

 LiteStep is designed to consume less resources than the Explorer shell which it
 replaces; so there are no system requirements above and beyond that which is
 needed for a normal Windows-based system.

 However, depending on what modules (add-ons) are loaded, any given desktop
 environment will have its own system requirements.  This may range from being
 only compatible with Win2K/XP or requiring a 3d accelerated graphics card.  Be
 sure to read the accompanying documentation for any theme or module that you
 choose to install.

-- INSTALL ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 NOTE:
 -----
 You are about to install a replacement shell for Windows.  A shell is not a
 normal application; it runs as a special system process.  Replacing the shell
 is not a supported procedure by Microsoft®, and as such, it is possible that if
 you do something wrong, you may end up with a non functional desktop and/ or
 your system may display an erroneous error message asking you to re-install
 Windows.  Do NOT panic, a very simple solution will put you back to where you
 need to be, so that you can fix whatever mistake you made, and try again.
 Please read the documentation on this topic that came with your LiteStep
 distribution, or review the "Manual Install" steps below.

 Now that you are ready to get going, there are a couple of methods to start
 using LiteStep.

 You MUST have administrative access to install LiteStep.

 A) LiteStep Distributions (Recommended and automated)
 -----------------------------------------------------

 The recommended way to start with LiteStep is to install one of the community
 driven LiteStep distributions.  Typically these distributions come with a
 friendly step by step installation wizard that will set your system up using a
 default desktop environment and theme.  Currently we recommend using LOSI -
 "LiteStep Open Source Installer" implementing the Open Theme Standard 2 (OTS2)
 by Tobbe.

 LOSI may be downloaded from at http://www.tlundberg.com/LOSI/

 Regardless of which distribution you use, you will find plenty of help on the
 LiteStep Mailing List (LSML) and user forums on one of the community websites.
 Please join us in our IRC channel #litestep on Freenode (irc.freenode.net) if
 you have any immediate support need.  However, be patient when asking a
 question as IRC is renown for being full of idlers.

 B) LiteStep From Scratch (Manual install and configuration)
 -----------------------------------------------------------

 STOP: If you are NOT highly familiar with editing the registry or reading
       lots of documentation and editing text configuration files, then this
       procedure is NOT for you!  Please use a LiteStep Distribution. Thank you.

 For the do-it-yourself type, please thoroughly read the following before
 proceeding.  It will save you a lot of headache.  I promise.

 Create a folder for LiteStep.  Generally this is done at "C:\LiteStep".

 Extract the contents of "LS-0.24.8.zip" to this folder.  Once the contents are
 extracted, there should be a file located at "C:\LiteStep\litestep.exe".

 Create a text file named "step.rc" and place it in the same folder as
 "litestep.exe".  Using the previous example location, this empty text file
 should now be at "C:\LiteStep\step.rc".

 Next, consult the section "USAGE (HELP)" to configure LiteStep via the step.rc
 text file (A sample step.rc is provided in that section).  Do NOT set LiteStep
 as your shell until you have configured it, otherwise you will be left with a
 dysfunctional (yet recoverable) system.

 To set LiteStep as your shell, follow these instructions:

  1. Win9x/ME

    - Using a text editor (e.g. Notepad) open the Windows System file named
      "system.ini".  This file's location is normally "C:\Windows\system.ini"

    - Locate the line that begins with "shell=".  This line is located in the
      "[boot]" section.  Typically the full line looks like "shell=explorer.exe"
      (without quotation marks).  Comment out this line (which disables it) by
      placing a semi-colon at the beginning of the line.  The line should now
      look like ";shell=explorer.exe" (without the quotation marks).

    - Create a new "shell=" line in the same location as the one removed.  This
      new line should contain the location of "litestep.exe".  For example it
      might look like "shell=C:\LiteStep\litestep.exe" (without the quotation
      marks).

    - Reboot your system.

    - README! When you reboot, if you get the error:

      "CANNOT FIND <shell file name> PLEASE REINSTALL WINDOWS"

      Do NOT reinstall windows!  Just simply follow the instructions below to
      put your shell back to the default:

      Boot into DOS (press F8 before Windows starts, or use a DOS boot disk).
      Issue the command "edit C:\Windows\system.ini" adjusting for the location
      of your system.ini file.  Delete the new line you created in the previous
      steps, and uncomment the line you previously disabled.  Do this by
      deleting the semicolon at the start of the line.  You should now have one
      line that starts with "shell=" in the "[boot]" section of the "system.ini"
      file, "shell=explorer.exe".  Save the file and reboot your system.

  2. Win2K/XP

    - Note: If you are NOT an administrator, you will most likely NOT be able to
      set LiteStep as your shell.  The only exception to this is if your System
      Administrator has enabled "per user" shells.  This is highly unlikely.

      While it is "possible" to run LiteStep at the same time as the default
      Explorer shell, it is discouraged and completely unsupported.  Good luck!

    - Open "regedit" or a similar utility.

    - To ENABLE "per user" shells:
      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
          \IniFileMapping\system.ini\boot

      * Change the string value named "Shell" to:

        USR:Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

    - To DISABLE "per user" shells:
      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
          \IniFileMapping\system.ini\boot

      * Change the string value named "Shell" to:

        SYS:Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

    - To set the system's DEFAULT shell (The shell all users use if "per user"
      shells are disabled, or if a user does not have a custom shell specified):
      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

      * Change the string value named "Shell" to the location of the file you
        want to use as your default system shell.

        For LiteStep use (adjust path as necessary):

          C:\LiteStep\litestep.exe

        For Explorer use (do not specify a path):

          Explorer.exe

    - To set the shell for the currently logged in user:
      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

      * Change (create) the string value named "Shell" to the location of the
        file you want to use as your current user shell.

        For LiteStep use (adjust path as necessary):

          C:\LiteStep\litestep.exe

        For Explorer use (do not specify a path):

          Explorer.exe

    - To use any shell besides Explorer, the following key MUST be changed.
      If you do not configure this key, you will not be able to use the
      Explorer File Manager.

      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer

      * Change (create) the DWORD value named "DesktopProcess" to a value of 1.

    - If you changed the "per user" shell setting, you MUST reboot.  Otherwise
      simply log off.  When you return to the desktop, LiteStep will be running
      as your shell if you managed to configure everything correctly.

    - If you end up with a blank or otherwise non-functional desktop.  Press
      CTRL+SHIFT+ESC key combination.  The Windows Task Manager will open.  Use
      the File menu to Run a New Task.  Launch your registry editor and use the
      previous instructions to set your system shell back to the default
      Explorer shell.

-- USAGE (HELP) ----------------------------------------------------------------

 The following section lays out the structure of LiteStep, and the available
 configuration options.  When used within this document to describe a parameter
 value, <> means a required parameter, and {} means an optional parameter.

 An always available built-in "Recovery Menu" can be accessed by pressing the
 key combination: CTRL+ALT+F1 that is, press and hold the CTRL key and the ALT
 key then depress the F1 key and release all three.  A popup menu will appear at
 your mouse cursor location.  This menu can be used recover from a broken
 configuration.

 A) LiteStep Structure
 ---------------------

 LiteStep is designed around a modular plugin system.  The LiteStep "core" by
 itself is rather useless to you until you configure and load a plugin.  These
 plugins are called "Modules" and are available from several LiteStep community
 websites (See the ABOUT section).

 The LiteStep core consists of:
  - litestep.exe     Main executable.  Loads modules, handles window messages
                     communication.  Runs startup apps, includes DDE and tray
                     services.

  - lsapi.dll        LiteStep API for modules to use.  Loads and parses step.rc;
                     handles $evars$ and all other configuration.  Manages !bang
                     commands, includes core !bangs.

  - hook.dll         The system shell hook used by some legacy LiteStep modules
                     for receiving global system messages.

 LiteStep also depends on "libpng13.dll" and "zlib1.dll" for Portable Network
 Graphics (PNG) image support.  Those two files must exist in the same directory
 as "litestep.exe" or in the system path.

 LiteStep uses a text configuration file named "step.rc" which must exist in the
 same directory as "litestep.exe".

 LiteStep loads Modules which use the LiteStep API "lsapi.dll" to read their
 configuration values, create advanced graphical displays and interact with the
 LiteStep core to provide you with a highly functional and eye-caching desktop.

 B) Command Line Parameters
 --------------------------

 "litestep.exe" has several command line switches to perform various actions.

  -nostartup
  ----------
   Disables running Windows startup items when loading LiteStep.

   This is useful on Windows 95, Windows 98(se) and Windows ME if you need to
   restart LiteStep.

   On Windows 2000 and Windows XP this switch is not needed as startup items are
   ran only once per session.

   Usage:
    litestep.exe -nostartup

  -startup
  --------
   Force running Windows startup items when loading LiteStep.

   On Windows 2000 and Windows XP, startup items are run only once per session.
   Using this switch overrides that behavior and forces startup item execution.

   This is not useful on Windows 95/98(se)/ME as startup items are always ran.

   Usage:
    litestep.exe -startup

  !<bang command>
  ---------------
   Passes the specified !bang command and parameters to a currently running
   instance of LiteStep.  The previous instance of LiteStep receiving the !bang
   command executes the specified !bang command.

   This is useful for external control of LiteStep, perhaps from a script.

   Usage:
    litestep.exe !recycle
    litestep.exe !ReloadModule "C:\LiteStep\modules\popup.dll"

  <file>
  ------
   Specifies the absolute path of the "step.rc" configuration file LiteStep
   should read its directives from.  This overrides the default of using the
   step.rc file located in the same folder as litestep.exe.

   Usage:
    litestep.exe C:\LiteStep\step.rc

 C) Step.rc Syntax
 -----------------

 The step.rc is formatted in a <command> {value} directive syntax.

  - There may be one directive per textual line.

  - <command> must not begin with a digit, be quoted, bracketed or in any other
    way use the reserved characters of the step.rc parsers except in the special
    case of * character.  The following characters are reserved:

    ! $ & * ( ) - + = [ ] ; " ' < > , /

    Furthermore it is recommended that you do not use @, #, or | (vertical bar),
    because these characters may become reserved in the future.

  - {value} is dependent per <command> directive and is explained in each
    directive's documentation.  If the directive is required by a Module, please
    read the corresponding documentation provided with the Module.  See the
    section "Step.rc Directive Parser" for more information on possible data
    types.

 LiteStep employs three levels of parsing to step.rc at load-time and expands
 variable references at runtime.

  1. Step.rc File Parser

    - The step.rc File Parser uses these reserved characters: ;[]"'

      ;  Used at the beginning of a textual line to delineate a comment.
         Comments are lines that are ignored by the Directive Parser.  A comment
         may also exist at the end of a <command> directive.  Everything after
         (and including) the semicolon is ignored.

      See "Step.rc Directive Parser" for other reserved character descriptions.

    - The File Parser behaves similarly to a pre-processor.  The File Parser is
      the first to touch the step.rc.

    - The step.rc File Parser evaluates the following Directives:

      Include
      If
      ElseIf
      Else
      Endif

  2. Step.rc Directive Parser

    - The step.rc Directive Parser uses these reserved characters: *$[]"'

      *  Used at the beginning of a <command> directive to delineate the ability
         to specify multiple <command>s of the same name (one per line).

      $$ Used as a set around a {value} parameter to delineate that a variable
         expansion should occur for that parameter.

      [] Used as a set around a {value} parameter to delineate that the contents
         are a single token value.

      "" Used as a set around a {value} parameter to delineate that any enclosed
         whitespace is part of the value (whitespace is TABs and SPACEs).

      '' Used as a set within the {value} parameter to delineate that the
         enclosed contents are a sub value.

    - The step.rc Directive Parser recognizes several {value} data types.

      (The examples given have fictitious directive names)

      Boolean
        Must be either TRUE or FALSE.

        Example: MyModuleHideIfEmpty TRUE

      Color
        Must be either in RGB Hexidecimal or Decimal Triplet formats.

        Example     (Hex): MyModuleBackgroundColor 4682B4
        Example (Decimal): MyModuleBackgroundColor 70 130 180

      Integer
        Must be a real Integer number

        Example: MyModuleWidth 32

      String
        Can be any non-reserved character set enclosed in quotation marks.

        Example: MyModuleDisplayText "This Module Rocks!"

      Undefined/Line
        An undefined value type can contain any data type, and is interpreted by
        a particular Module's implementation and documentation.  For example
        a Module could require a single Directive Line contain both an Integer
        and String data type within a single {value}.

        Example: MyModuleFont Bold 16 "Courier New"

  3. Step.rc Evaluation Parser

    - The Evaluation Parser is used by the File Parser in evaluation of the
      conditional directives: If and ElseIf.  It is also used by the Runtime
      Variable Expansion handler.  The Evaluation Parser looks at the expression
      in these parts: Variables (values), Operators and Functions.

    - Data Types

      Values in an expression are of one three fundamental types: boolean,
      number, or string.  Booleans are logical true or false values.  Numbers
      are IEEE 754 double-precision numbers, which includes the special values:
      positive/negative infinity and Not a Number (NaN).  There is no distinct
      integer data type, as integers are subsumed by the number type.  Strings
      are sequences of characters.

      As an expression is evaluated, values are automatically converted to
      different types as necessary.  In the event that an explicit type
      conversion is needed, use one of the conversion functions.  Whether
      implicit or explicit, type conversions follow the same set of rules, which
      are described in the section on Functions, below.

    - Undefined Variables

      For compatibility reasons, conditional expressions (If and ElseIf) can use
      undefined variables without generating an error.  Any operator or function
      applied to an undefined value produces an undefined result.  If the result
      of a conditional expression is undefined, then it is treated as if it were
      false.

      This behavior, while supported in 0.24.8, will be removed in the future.
      The correct way to detect undefined variables is to use the "defined"
      keyword:

        If defined(SomeVariable)
        If not defined(AnotherVariable)

      Defined behaves like a function that takes a variable name and returns
      true if that variable is defined or false if it is not.  Defined is not,
      however, a real function because its argument must be a variable name.

      Using an undefined variable in an inline expression (one enclosed in $'s)
      generates an error, just as it always has.

    - Operators

      The operators that LiteStep supports are listed below from highest
      precedence to lowest precedence.  With the exception of the three unary
      operators, all operators are binary and left associative.

      Parentheses:    ( )
      Unary:          + - not
      Multiplicative: * / div mod
      Additive:       + -
      Concatenation:  &
      Relational:     = < <= > >= <> !=
      Logical AND:    and
      Logical OR:     or

      Identity (unary +)
        Returns the operand, converted to a number.

      Negation (unary -)
        Returns the negative of the operand, converted to a number.

      Logical Complement (not)
        Returns the logical complement of the operand, converted to a Boolean.

      Multiplication (*)
        Returns the product of the operands, converted to numbers.

      Division (/)
        Returns the ratio of the operands, converted to numbers.

      Integer Division (div)
        Returns the quotient from a truncating division of the operands,
        converted to numbers.

      Modulus (mod)
        Returns the remainder from a truncating division of the operands,
        converted to numbers.

      Addition (+)
        Returns the sum of the operands, converted to numbers.

      Subtraction (-)
        Returns the difference of the operands, converted to numbers.

      Concatenation (&)
        Returns the concatenation of the operands, converted to strings.

      Relational Operators (=, <, <=, >, >=, <>, !=)
        Returns true if the given relationship holds between the operands.  If
        both operands are strings then they are compared as strings, otherwise
        they are compared as numbers.  The inequality operators <> and != are
        interchangeable.  String comparison is case-sensitive.

      Logical AND (and)
        Returns true if both of the operands, converted to Booleans, are true.

      Logical OR (or)
        Returns true if either of the operands, converted to Booleans, are true.

    - Functions

      LiteStep supports a small set of built-in functions that you can use in
      expressions.  These functions are listed below in alphabetical order, with
      a short description.

      abs(number)
        Returns the absolute value of the argument, converted to a number.

      boolean(value)
        Returns its argument, converted to a Boolean.  Zero, Not a Number (NaN),
        and the empty string map to false.  All other values map to true.

      ceil(number)
        Returns the ceiling (least greater integer) of the argument, converted
        to a number.

      contains(string, string)
        Returns true if the second argument, converted to a string, is a
        substring of the first argument, converted to a string.

      endsWith(string, string)
        Returns true if the second argument, converted to a string, is a suffix
        of the first argument, converted to a string.

      floor(number)
        Returns the floor (greatest lesser integer) of the argument, converted
        to a number.

      if(condition, then, else)
        Converts its first argument to a Boolean.  If its true, returns the
        second argument (then). If its false, returns the third argument (else).
        This function lets you do simple conditionals in an inline expression.

      integer(value)
        Returns the argument, converted to an integer.  Conversion to integer is
        the same as conversion to number, except that infinites and NaNs become
        zero.

      length(string)
        Returns the length of the argument, converted to a string.

      lowerCase(string)
        Returns the argument, converted to a string, in lower case.

      max(number, number)
        Returns the larger of its arguments, converted to numbers.

      min(number, number)
        Returns the smaller of its arguments, converted to numbers.

      number(value)
        Returns its argument, converted to a number.  For Booleans, true maps to
        1 and false maps to 0.  A string is parsed as a numeric literal; if
        parsing fails, the string is mapped to NaN.

      pow(number, number)
        Returns the first argument, converted to a number, raised to the power
        of the second argument, converted to a number.

      round(number)
        Returns the argument, converted to a number, rounded to the nearest
        integer.

      startsWith(string, string)
        Returns true if the second argument, converted to a string, is a prefix
        of the first argument, converted to a string.

      string(value)
        Returns the argument, converted to a string.  For Booleans, true maps to
        "true" and false maps to "false".  Numbers are formatted as strings in
        the standard way.

      sqrt(number)
        Returns the square root of the argument, converted to a number.

      upperCase(string)
        Returns the argument, converted to a string, in upper case.

  4. Runtime Variable Expansion

    - Variable expansion supports textual replacements and expression
      evaluation when enclosed within a set of $ characters.
      (e.g. $LiteStepDir$ or $ScreenWidth - 32$)

      See "Step.rc Evaluation Parser" section above.

  5. Images, Icons and Magic Pink

    - Modules may require the loading of an image file.

      LiteStep can currently load BMP and PNG image files as well as icons from
      ICO files and resource libraries.

      (The examples below use the fictitious directive "ModuleBackgroundImage")

      To load a normal BMP or PNG image file, simply specify the path to the
      file in the Module's configuration directive that requires an image file.

        ModuleBackgroundImage "C:\folder\image.bmp"

      To load an icon from an ICO file or resource library for use as an image,
      use the syntax:

        ModuleBackgroundImage ".extract=<icon resource>"

      Where <icon resource> specifies the icon to load. See below for further
      details on the syntaxt for loading icons. Please note that the ".extract="
      prefix is required when loading an icon file when the Module is expecting
      a normal image file.

      To load and merge multiple images into a single image, separate the file
      paths with the pipe character | using the syntax:

        ModuleBackgroundImage "C:\folder\image1.png|C:\folder\image2.png{|...}"

      where the last image specified will be on bottom, and the first image
      specified will be on top. It is possible to include an icon resource in
      this merging syntax as well, just use the ".extract=" prefix.

      Relative paths refer to files in the LiteStep image directory. Refer to
      LSImageFolder Step.rc directive for details.

    - If an image contains the "magic pink" RGB color 255 0 255 (FF00FF) then
      the portion of the image that is "magic pink" will be rendered transparent
      to the content below it.  Some modules require a separate configuration
      setting to enable or disable transparency support.  Refer to the Module's
      documentation.

    - Modules may require the specific loading of icon files.  LiteStep supports
      loading icons from any icon resource file or archive as well as loading an
      icon associated with a desktop.ini file.

      It is possible to load an icon using the following syntax:

      Directly load an icon file:

        "C:\path\to\file.ico"

      Extract an icon from a resource library (.icl, .dll, .exe, et cetera)
      using the specified resource index (in this example, index 9):

        "C:\path\to\icon\library.icl,9"

      Extract the associated icon from a folder's "desktop.ini" file:

        "C:\path\to\some\folder\"

      Relative paths refer to files in the LiteStep image directory. Refer to
      LSImageFolder Step.rc directive for details. 

 D) Step.rc Directives
 ---------------------

  Include <file>
  --------------
   Specifies an additional step.rc format file to include.

   Usage:
    Include C:\LiteStep\config\theme.rc

  If, ElseIf, Else, and EndIf
  ---------------------------
   Conditionally parse a section of the step.rc.

   The If directive marks the start of a conditional section.  The If directive
   evaluates an expression to produce a true (nonzero) or false (zero) result.
   If the result is true then the lines following up to the next ElseIf, Else,
   or EndIf are parsed, otherwise they are ignored.

   The ElseIf directive behaves like an If, but the expression is evaluated only
   if all of the previous If and ElseIf expressions have evaluated to false.

   The Else directive parses the lines that follow it only if all the previous
   If and Elseif expressions have evaluated to false.  There may be at most one
   Else and it must follow any ElseIf statements.

   The EndIf directive marks the end of a conditional section.  Each If
   directive must have a corresponding EndIf.  If-EndIf blocks may be nested to
   any depth.

   See "Step.rc Evaluation Parser" section above for conditional operators and
   expression syntax.  When referencing LiteStep variables (e-vars) do not
   enclose the variable references in dollar signs ($) when they occur in
   conditional expressions (dollar signs are only used in Runtime Variable
   Expansion - see above named section).

   Usage:
    If <expression>
     <lines>
    ElseIf <expression>
     <lines>
    Else
     <lines>
    EndIf

  LoadModule <file>
  -----------------
   Specifies a Module (plugin) to load.

   Usage:
    LoadModule C:\LiteStep\modules\popup.dll

  LSNoStartup <boolean>
  ---------------------
   Disables running of system Startup items.

   Note: LiteStep must be restarted for this setting to take affect.

   Usage:
    LSNoStartup TRUE

  LSAutoHideModules <boolean>
  ---------------------------
   Automatically hides all LiteStep modules from the display when an application
   enters Full Screen mode. (e.g. A full screen game)

   Usage:
    LSAutoHideModules TRUE

  LSNoShellWarning <boolean>
  --------------------------
   Disables the warning issued when loading LiteStep if another shell is already
   running.  Do not use this setting unless you know what you are doing!

   Note: LiteStep must be restarted for this setting to take affect.

   Usage:
    LSNoShellWarning TRUE

  LSSetAsShell <boolean>
  ----------------------
   Registers LiteStep as the system shell on load.  This will enable an
   automatic re-spawn of LiteStep if LiteStep exits inadvertently.  However,
   this feature is experimental and not recommended at this time.  If you
   experience problem using Explorer as your file manager, try disabling this
   setting.

   Note: LiteStep must be restarted for this setting to take affect.

   Usage:
    LSSetAsShell TRUE

  LSUseSystemDDE <boolean>
  ------------------------
   Enables Dynamic Data Exchange under LiteStep.  This is required to enable
   many features of the Explorer file manager and other system services.
   However its functionality is not fully developed at this time and
   irregularities may exist.  If you experience resource usage troubles, try
   disabling this setting.

   Note: LiteStep must be restarted for this setting to take affect.

   Usage:
    LSUseSystemDDE TRUE

  LSDisableTrayService <boolean>
  ------------------------------
   Disables the Icon Notification (Systray) service.  This is useful if you have
   to run LiteStep on top of another shell, or if you have another application
   implementing the service.

   Note: LiteStep must be restarted for this setting to take affect.

   Usage:
    LSDisableTrayService TRUE

  LSImageFolder <path>
  --------------------
   Sets the default folder that LiteStep looks in when loading images.  This
   will default to <install path>\images\ (e.g. C:\LiteStep\images\).

   Usage:
    LSImageFolder "C:\LiteStep\themes\mytheme\images\"

  ThemeAuthor <string>
  --------------------
   Sets the name of the Author of the current Theme and is displayed in the
   !About box dialog.

   Usage:
    ThemeAuthor "Mr. ThemeWizard"

  ThemeName <string>
  ------------------
   Sets the name of the current Theme and is displayed in the !About box dialog.

 G) Sample Step.rc
 -----------------

 STOP: Copying and pasting the following to your step.rc will *NOT* give you a
       working LiteStep installation.  You will first need to download the
       relevant modules and extract them to your LiteStep folder.

 NOTE: The step.rc contents is what exists between {BeginStepRC} and {EndStepRC}
       not including those two delimiters.  Create the step.rc file in the same
       folder as litestep.exe.

{BeginStepRC}
; This is an EXAMPLE step.rc file.  This example will NOT work without
; downloading the necessary modules (plugins) and placing them in the
; same folder as litestep.exe.

; First, we need to load the modules (plugins) that we want to use.
; You may download these modules from:
;  http://www.shellfront.org/modules-list.php
; Extract these modules into your LiteStep folder.
LoadModule $LiteStepDir$hotkey.dll    ; hotkey-2.0.zip
LoadModule $LiteStepDir$popup2.dll    ; popup2-2.1.5.zip

; Configure a Hotkey combination to launch Notepad and open this
; step.rc configuration file.
*Hotkey WIN+CTRL   S   notepad.exe "$LiteStepDir$step.rc"

; Configure a Hotkey to recycle (restart) LiteStep.  This will reload
; this step.rc configuration file with any changes, and reload all modules.
*Hotkey WIN+CTRL   R   !recycle

; Configure a Hotkey to open an explorer window and quit LiteStep.
*Hotkey WIN+CTRL   Q   !execute [explorer.exe /e,/root,,$Drives$][!quit]

; Configure a Hotkey to display LiteStep's "About" dialog.
*Hotkey WIN+CTRL   A   !about

; Configure a few default hotkeys that emulate Explorer's functionality
*Hotkey WIN        C   explorer.exe /root,,$Controls$
*Hotkey WIN        E   explorer.exe /e,/root,,$Drives$
*Hotkey WIN        L   !logoff
*Hotkey WIN        M   !MinimizeWindows
*Hotkey WIN+SHIFT  M   !RestoreWindows
*Hotkey WIN        R   !run

; NOTE: pressing CTRL+ESC or the Windows Key will display the Popup Menu.
; The Hotkey module automatically configures those hotkeys by default.

; Next, we will configure a basic Popup Menu.
HotlistName "LiteStep 0.24.8"
PopupIcons
PopupAdaptiveWidth
PopupMinWidth 125
PopupMaxWidth 300
PopupNoBevel

*Popup "My Computer" !PopupMyComputer
*Popup !Separator
