    - Added support for all ITaskbarList* interfaces. 
    - Fixed crash with recursive includes.


  - REMOVED/CHANGED -
    - The official spelling is now "LiteStep". There used to be a mix of
      "Litestep" and "LiteStep".
    - No more attempts to silently swallow exceptions (crashes) from modules.
      Instead, LiteStep will just crash outright. Trying to continue leaves
      LiteStep in a state which is prone to crash in a non-reproducible way.
    - Streamlined error messages during LiteStep startup (core only). Removed
      specialized error boxes e.g. from TrayService.
    - Error message boxes are now consistenly "topmost". They no longer set
      themselves as foreground window.
    - Removed hook.dll (was never used)
    - If a custom configuration file path is passed on the command line and the
      file does not exist, LiteStep now shows a "file not found" error message
      instead of falling back to the standard step.rc.
    - Removed lsapi.dll from !about "Revision IDs"
    - Switched from libpng to picoPNG, which is included in lsapi.dll.
      - Removes libpng13.dll and zlib1.dll dependencies
    - Removed Win95 multimon compat functions
    - Added more details to the error message that is shown when a module fails
      to load.
 
 
  - INTERNAL -
    - Lots of code consistency and correctness improvements
    - Huge code format update
    - Several small improvements in code structure
    - Removed lots of unused code
    - Several small fixes to support compiling as a 64-Bit application
    - Several improvements for debug builds (e.g. thread names)
    - Removed VC6 as a supported compiler/development environment
    - Added lots of debug TRACEs
