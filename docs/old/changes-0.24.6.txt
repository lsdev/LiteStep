             CommandBackgroundColor $ThemeBackgroundColor$
    This should work with Colors, Int, Bools, and String... so everything pretty much
  - Moved the recovery menu function into seperate files just organize the source a little
    bit more
  - Added !SwitchUser to change users in XP (from [steev])
  - Added DesktopOnDisplayChange setting... will run the specified command when the display
    properties are changed

- Fixed [vwm2 / Message / 2001-12-10]

		NoPopupMenuBevel = PopupNoMenuBevel  

- Fixed [systray2, litestep / Message / 2001-11-26]
  - Systray2, Stripped everything out of it except for basic gui, this module will 
    not run without a new build
  - More Traymanager fixes, uses new LSNOTIFYICONDATA structure to support longer
    tooltips. System tray modules will have to be updated before being used with this
    build. System tray must issue the LM_SYSTRAYREADY message when they are ready to
    receive the icons, and must not post the "TaskbarCreated" message.
  - Removed the tray project from the LiteStep workspace

- Changed [lsapi / Message / 2001-11-25 ]
  - Made the default build of lsapi now include PNG support
    Use "Release/Debug Without PNG" to build an lsapi.dll without PNG  

- Fixed [litestep, systray2 / Message / 2001-11-21]
  - Added TrayManager to LiteStep, this takes over the function of managing the system
    tray from systray modules. Now includes W2k support.
  - LM_SAVESYSTRAY, LM_RESTORESYSTRAY messages no longer required and do no function
  - Modified systray2 to only activate it's w2k support if used on a system without
    TrayManager
    
  NOTE: Do not use Maduin's Systray 1.05b with w2k support with this build, it will
  probably result in multiple icons or other weirdness

- Fixed [systray2 / Message / 2001-11-21]
  - Added Windows2000 and WindowxXP support. Seems to work fine when first loaded,
    but after a recycle w2k loses its volume icon and xp loses all icons (?). A simple fix
    for w2k is to run trayfix.exe after a recycle, and that will put the volume icon back.
    
    NOTES:
    The DUN icon uses 4 icons to display status, when NIM_ADD the icons, they all have the
    same HWND, but differ in NOTIFYICONDATA.uID. To get around this, we only check to see
    if an icon already exists by HWND only, and not uID. On NIM_MODIFY, we set the uID
    of any found icon to the modifying icon's uID or problems occur with the mouse handling.
    
    UnloadShellServiceObjects needs to be called before LM_SAVESYSTRAY is handled or
    the DUN/Volume icons get saved also and won't be handled properly when the tray is
    restarted after a recycle.
    
    The tooltip on the DUN icon still doesn't handle well. I think this is our implementation
    and not MS related.
    
- Fixed [everything / Message / 2001-11-20]
  - Removed all the TCHAR, _TEXT hoopla (it was never properly implemented fully
    and just made the source look like poo)
  - Source formatting! All the source should have a standard look now.
    (formatting done using the astyle @ http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/astyle)
    (command line options were: astyle -cbKpt *.cpp *.h *.c)
    (Using tabs instead of spaces)
    
- Fixed [hook, hookmgr, litestep / Message / 2001-11-20]

  - Modified IBangManager and IBangCommand interfaces to more close fit what
    bang commands do

  - Reimplemented StepSettings internally with wide chars (wchar_t)
    - Reduces number of conversions done to use the component
    - COM uses wchar_t in the form of BSTR's
    - Should improve settings performance
    - One exception: GetFullPathName is not provided in wide char form under 9X,
      so a conversion is done to ANSI char and back again. This will preclude the
      parser from working with files with UNICODE chars in them without modification.
      Normally you won't have to worry about it.
  - Modified IWindowList interface to not use HRESULT to make it more simple to use.
  - Reimplemented StandardWindowList to support new interface
  - Made minor modifications to several pieces of code to allow LS to compile with
    STLPort, a port of SGI's STL libraries. STLPort will not be used by default.
    - STLPort causes binaries to be very slightly larger, and LS to take about
      300k more memory, but is free and open. Recompile LS using STLPort headers
      and libraries if you are interested. See www.stlport.org
  - Added /opt:NOWIN98 linker option to projects that didn't have it
    - Shrinks the binaries a touch

                    ctrl        control key down
                    shift       shift key down

    Examples:
    *desktop rbutton !popup // Right button up displays popup
    *desktop lbutton !about // Left button up displays about box
    *desktop lbutton+ctrl !recycle // Left button up while holding down control key
                                      recycles LiteStep
    *desktop rbutton+ctrl+shift !quit // You can figure it out =]

    Note: you can do *desktop rbutton+lbutton !about and it will display the
    about box when you hold down the lbutton and click the rbutton, *but* releasing
    the lbutton will fire off the command set by *desktop lbutton
  - Added !DesktopSetClick, you use this in the same way as the step.rc config, just

  - Turned off warning message when using ShellExecute via LsExecute, this will
    keep that annoying "access to the specified device, path, or file was
    denied" window from popping up

- Modified [command, lsapi / Message / 2000-12-01]
  - Added CommandNotAlwaysOnTop, CommandSelectAllOnFocus to command.dll
  - Cleaned up some of the multimon macros in macros.h, no need to check if
    the system is multimon or not, multimon.h does that.

- Fixed [popup2 / Chaku / 2000-12-01]
  - Fixed the problem that when left or right clicking on an item that has
    submenu the whole popup will be closed.

- Modified [Shortcut2 / NeXTer / 2000-11-30]
  - Cleaned up the new code

- Fixed [Shortcut2 / Message / 2000-11-30]
  - Added code to move a shortcut whose position was not on a display monitor
    to the nearest monitor (This should cure the problem with shortcuts not
    being visible because of different resolution in multimon systems)

- Modified [Shortcut2 / NeXTer / 2000-11-30]
  - Added the 'r' flag that makes the shortcut relative to the one before it

- Modified [ command, lsapi, desktop2, shortcut2 / Message / 2000-11-28]
             taskbar, vwm2, popup2
  - Added basic Multimonitor support. (Top-Left corner of left most monitor is
    given the coordinates (0,0), everything else is relative to that. Negative
    coordinates are relative to the right side of the right most monitor or
    relative to the bottom of the lowest monitor)

- Modified [popup2 / Message / 2000-11-27]
  - Per mindjunctions: !PopupFolder, !PopupDynamicFolder, & !DynamicFolder now
    support an optional file pattern. this goes after the directory. Currently only
    one patern is allowed, and it will no span subdirectories unless those
    subdirectories match the pattern.
    Example: *Popup 	"Documents" 	"!PopupDynamicFolder:$documentsdir$" *.doc
    Makes a popup menu titled "Documents" containing only the *.doc files from the
    My Documents directory

- Modified [lsapi / Message / 2000-11-27]
  - Fixed qouted paths in include
  - General code cleaning in VarExpansion unitialized variable checking
  - GetLitestepWnd() now caches the hwnd on the first call to prevent subsequent
    calls to FindWindow
  - Implemented some new macros for resource string loading in macros.h
  - Modules using GetResStr and GetResStrEx have been converted to using the macros

== Build 2000-11-28 ===========================================================

- Modified [lsapi / Message / 2000-11-27]
  - Added include to step.rc parsing, allows for inclusion
    of other files when loading the step.rc
    syntax is include <path & file name>
    e.g. include $litestepdir$popup.rc
    included files are processed where they are included
    (so don't use variables defined after the include statement
    in the included file)

- Modified [vwm2, sysvwm, lsapi/ Chaku / 2000-11-27]
  - Modified !VWMMoveApp, !VWMOpen, !VWMDesk to accept desktop names for vwm2
  - Fixed the way desktop names are handled in sysvwm, so that first character of the desktop
	name can be a number.
  - Fixed !VWMDesk's boundary checking problem, but not !VWMMoveApp's yet
  - Added my name to the about box :-)

- Modified [Command, Lsapi / Message / 2000-11-27]
  - Added CommandBevel to put a bevel around the command window
  - Added CommandBevelSize, CommandBevelLightColor, CommandBevelDarkColor
  - Fixed Frame3D, it was swapping some coordinates
  - Added inclusion of lsdebug.h to macros.h
  - Added some basic error checking to macros.h to verify proper order of
    include files. (macros.h needs to be included before windows.h)

- Modified [Popup2 / NeXTer / 2000-11-27]
  - Fixed the RevID so that the right version number is reported

- Modified [sysvwm / Chaku / 2000-11-25]
  - Fixed UnRegisterBangCommands function, so that it actually remove all the bangs
  - Modified !VWMMoveApp to accept desktop number(starts from 0).
  - Modified !VWMMoveApp, !VWMOpen, !VWMDesk to accept desktop names.

- Modified [command, lsapi, popup2, hookmgr, hook / Message / 2000-11-24]
  - Added !CommandFocus - will show the command window if it is hidden and
    set focus in the edit control
  - Added response to LM_REFRESH & !Refresh
  - Added _LSDEBUGPRINTMSG(text, msg) to lsdebug.h, msg is an int representing a
    window message, when the output the int will be in hex form
    E.G. _LSDEBUGPRINTMSG("WM_LBUTTONUP", 514) will output:
    <filename>:<line number> WM_LBUTTONUP = 202
  - Fixed drop files to inclose a path in qoutes if it included spaces when using
    !PopupRun
  - Readded code to hookmgr and hook to handle CallWndProc, evidently the cause
    for the lockups was the hooking of the debugger (in my case deb.exe), so code
    has been added to keep the deb.exe proccess from being hooked. Anyone using hooks
    should replace "deb.exe" in hook.cpp with the name of their debugger. (The code to
    enable CallWndProc is enabled by defining _TEST_CODE)

- Modified [command / Message / 2000-11-24]
  - Added !CommandShow, !CommandHide, !CommandToggle, CommandHideOnUnfocus,
    CommandHiddenOnStart, CommandNoClearOnCommand (these all function exactly
    like their lsxcommand counterparts)

== Build 2000-11-24 ===========================================================

- Modified [command, lsapi / Message / 2000-11-24]
  - Command.dll is now functional on the basic level, see command.txt for details
  - Added _LSDEBUGLASTERR to lsdebug.h, it calls GetLastError and passes it to
    FormatMessage to retrieve the error message for the error number then outputs
    the message using OutputDebugString
  - Added _LSDEBUGLASTERR2(dword) to lsdebug.h, same functionality as _LSDEBUGLASTERR
    but uses an error number passed into it instead of GetLastError
  - Added macros.h to lsapi project to hold commonly used macros
    - Added CONVERT_COORDINATE_X(x) and CONVERT_COORDINATE_Y(y) to macros.h, they convert
      a negative coordinate to be relative from the right/bottom of the screen
  - Changed to LSExecute and LSExecuteEx's return values to something more sensible, it would
    return anything from 0, NULL or an error before if it failed, now it returns a value in
    accordance with ShellExecute. A value greater than 32 if successful and a value less than
    or equal to 32 if it fails. This should allow for the ability to tell if a command executed
    failed or succeeded properly now
  - Added MRUList class (mru.cpp and mru.h) to lsapi project, allows for the use of a common
    storage for modules needing to maintain a MRU run list. See command.cpp for an example
    implementation.

- Modified [taskbar / Chaku / 2000-11-24]
  - Fixed the start button text position problem, and the non-responsive mouse
    clicking when start button is absent

- Modified [Desktop2 / NeXTer / 2000-11-23]
  - The !DesktopSetArea command is finally working, I must have been very
    tired when I wrote that code. Not only did it call the wrong function,
    but also registered the wrong command. That noone hasn't noticed before
    now is pretty remarkable

- Modified [taskbar / Chaku / 2000-11-22]
  - Added the task flashing feature, TaskButtonFlash, and some flashing color
    and skining code.

- Fixed [popup2 / Kevin / 2000-11-21]
  - Popups other than the default one did not adjust their position to make
    sure they were within the screen.

- Modified [LiteStep / NeXTer / 2000-11-21]
  - Added the ability to specify bang commands on the command line. The bang
    has to be the last argument since everything following it is assumed to
    be the arguments for the bang (NOTE: This requires that LS is already
    running)

- Modified [ShortCut2 / NeXTer / 2000-11-21]
  - Added the ability to place shortcuts relative the screen center. Just add
    a 'c' after the relevant coordinate (i.e., -42c)

== Build 2000-11-21 ===========================================================

- New Feature [popup2 / Kevin / 2000-11-20]
  - Merged in Chaku's code for multiple popups

- New Feature [lsapi / Kevin / 2000-11-19]
  - New bang command: !alert <message> <title>
    - Displays a message box with the given message and title
    - <title> is optional
  - New bang command: !confirm <message> <title> <yes-command> <no-command>
    - Displays a message box with the given message and title and lets
      the user select "Yes" or "No"; then executes the appropriate
      command.
    - <title> is optional. <yes-command> and <no-command> must be
      enclosed in brackets if they have parameters

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 2000-11-17]
  - Removed a little overhead in the function setting the internal variables
  - Removed the appending of a '\' to environment variables (type set in a console)
    since this screwed up if the var referenced a file (comspec), and making an
    accurate identification would take too much time, and fail for removable media

- Modified [sysvwm, vwm2 / Maduin / 2000-11-16]
  - Added new messages to let other modules (popup2, namely) get desktop information.
  - You can now give each desktop a name with the RC command VWMDeskNameN where
    N is the desktop number. While these names aren't currently used by the VWM for
    anything, popup2 (and eventually other modules) can use them.

- Modified [popup2 / Maduin / 2000-11-16]
  - !PopupTasks can now be used as a regular bang command
  - Added !PopupDesktops which lists the VWM desktops (with names) and lets you
      switch between them. This can also be used as a regular bang command.
      (This requires the new sysvwm.dll or vwm2.dll)

- Modified [popup2 / Maduin / 2000-11-15]
  - Added PopupDefaultIcon to specify a default icon for entries with none
  - Added PopupIconSpacing to set the number of pixels between the icon and the text
  - Added PopupIconSize to resize icons
  - Added PopupEntryAlignment and PopupTitleAlignment to set the horizontal
      alignment of text. The value can be "left", "center", or "right". The default
      is "left". These don't work perfectly with icons yet; but they're a work in
      progress.
  - Fixed a little memory leak

- Changed [Popup2 / Message / 2000-11-12]
  - Removed 2000-10-18 additions to popup2 for right click open
  - Implemented right click context menus for the following items: !PopupFolder,
    !PopupDynamicFolder, !DynamicFolder, !PopupMyComputer, !PopupNetwork, !PopupControlPanel,
    !PopupPrinters (this code is by no means perfect, i.e. sub menus on the context menu
    do not function, i.e. the send to menu)

- Fixed [Litestep / Message / 2000-11-10]
  - Finished converting void installLitestep(LPCSTR szPath) to use resource
    strings, only void uninstallLitestep() in litestep.cpp is left to do
  - Added an uninstall litestep option to the ctl-alt-f1 recovery menu
  - Changed the recovery menu to use GetResStr instead of LoadString to allow
    for localization

- Fixed [Desktop2 / NeXTer / 2000-11-07]
  - Oups... Setting the parent to the desktop made it show up in the task
    list. Back to the drawing board

- Rollback [Popup2 / NeXTer / 2000-11-07]
  - Due to compatibility problems, Popup2 has been rolled back to the
    pre-2000-11-04 state. The changes will be re-added when the problems have
    been fixed

- Modified [Desktop2 / NeXTer / 2000-11-07]
  - Changed the parent window to the desktop and removed the clipping.
    This should (theoretically) make it easier to adapt LS to a multi-monitor
    setup

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 2000-11-06]
  - Added the envvar UserName

- Modified [sysvwm / NeXTer / 2000-11-03]
  - Added support for LSBox
  - Fixed a lot of problems with the mouse handling

- Added [Desktop2 / NeXTer / 2000-11-01]
  - Added !DesktopSetArea left top right bottom, the rules are the same as
    for the normal settings

- Fixed [DllMgr / NeXTer / 2000-11-01]
  - The module map was case sensitive, which is rather silly on a case insensitive
    file system

- Fixed [LiteStep / NeXTer / 2000-10-30]
  - The -install/-uninstall feature is no longer broken under 9x (why hasn't
    anyone reported this before?)

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 2000-10-30]
  - Cleaned up GetToken() a bit. Had forgotten a couple of silly things the
    last time I changed it

- Modified [Wharf / NeXTer / 2000-10-29]
  - After inceasant pestering by DeViLbOi, WharfAlwaysOnTop now defaults to
    false

- Modified [lsapi / Maduin / 2000-10-19]
  - Added simple expression support to If. Now supports boolean
    connectives ("and", "or" and "not") and comparison of integers
	using relational operators (=, <>, <=, <, >=, >). Support for
	strings and arithmetic is coming.

- Modified [lsapi / Message / 2000-10-18]
  - Added two new variables ResolutionX and ResolutionY which is the screen height and
    width in pixels, not very usefull with the current if,else implementation, but
    provided for future use with expressions

- Added [Popup2 / Message / 2000-10-18]
  - Right clicking on a menu item that is a !PopupFolder or !PopupDynamicFolder, or one of
    of their subfolders. will cause the directory to be opened in a single pane explorer
    window

- Modified [lsapi / Maduin / 2000-10-18]
  - Added preliminary support for conditionals (If/ElseIf/Else/EndIf) to the
    step.rc. It doesn't support real expressions yet, but you can conditionally
	process blocks of commands based on variables.
  - Added predefined variables for OS detection (useful with conditionals)
  - LSAPI.TXT has more detailed information on both of these

- Fixed [Lsapi / Message / 2000-10-14]
  - If a variable is a system variable (i.e. $windir$) it will now append a
    backslash to the variable, this should make all directory variables behave the
    same with a back slash now

== Build 2000-10-06 ===========================================================

- Modified [Shortcut2 / NeXTer / 2000-10-06]
  - The caption set for the shortcut is now set as the window caption for
    the shortcut, so that operations can be performed on individual shortcuts
    when using an advanced scripting module
  - Added the ability to set whether or not captions are shown for all and
    individual shortcuts. See shortcut2.txt for details

- Modified [Wharf, LSAPI / NeXTer / 2000-10-03]
  Wharf:
  - Fixed the sound handling, thanks to DeViLbOi for pointing it out
  LSAPI:
  - Changed GetRCBoolDef() to interpret the value as true if declared but not
    assigned a value, or assigned a value not recognized as a false

- Modified [LiteStep, Hotkey / NeXTer / 2000-10-02]
  LiteStep:
  - Cleaned up the about dialog a bit
  Hotkey:
  - Enter, Mul, Div, Add, Sub and Dec (decimal key) are now supported

- Added [command / Message / 2000-09-26]
  - Added start of the "lsxcommand" type core module

- Modified [taskbar, systray2 / noodge, Message / 2000-09-25]
  - Added resource strings.

- Modified [desktop, desktop2, dllmgr, hookmgr, hotkey, litestep / Message / 2000--09-25]
  - Changed resource string identifier to use the following pattern IDS_<MODULENAME>_ERROR<#>

- Modified [litestep / Maduin / 2000-09-21]
  - If Litestep is rendered unusable due to problems with modules and/or
    themes, you can hit Ctrl+Alt+F1 to bring up a recovery menu with a few
	basic commands (recycle, quit, run, shutdown) that should help you fix
	the problem.

- Modified [popup2 / Maduin / 2000-09-21]
  - Added the following menu items (these work just like !PopupTasks)
    - !PopupMyComputer
    - !PopupNetwork
    - !PopupControlPanel
    - !PopupPrinters
  - Added NoPopupTitleText to prevent the display of title text while
    still displaying the title graphic.
  - The bottom bitmap (PopupBottomPix) can now be any height; before
    it had to be the same height as the title bitmap.
  - Integrated the .icon support from popup 9.3. If icons are enabled
    (PopupIcons) then you can explicitly assign an icon to an entry with:
	  *Popup .icon=custom.ico "Title" command.exe
	This works for all popup item types. If the icon file name has spaces
	in it then you must enclose the whole thing in quotes (".icon=a b.ico").

- Modified [litestep, lsapi / Message / 2000-09-17]
  - Added new settings for the about box, ThemeName and ThemeAuthor, to be displayed in the
    about box, ThemeName can be 20 characters long and ThemeAuthor 15 characters long

- Modified [install3 / Headius / 2000-09-04]
  - Added a couple more dialogs to the install3 project

- Fixed [hotkey / Headius / 2000-09-04]
  - Hotkeys were case sensitive, and windows expected caps
    - i.e. "Win A" worked..."Win a" did not
	- Always registered as the capitolized version

== Build 2000-09-04 ===========================================================

- Fixed [lsapi, vwm2, wharf / Headius / 2000-09-04]
  - Removed support for TransparentBlt Win32 API call
    - Windows98 implementation seems to be leaking, may have been source of tasks.dll problems
    - Let me know if this fixes tasks problems
  - Removed extraneous call to destroyWindow in VWM2
    - Resulted in window being destroyed twice, with subsequent memory errors
  - Fixed calls to CombineRgn in Wharf
    - Calls were made with a null destination, causing first-chance exceptions

- Modified [LSAPI, Popup2, Wharf, SysTray2, Taskbar / NeXTer / 2000-08-31]
  - Altered the WM_POPUP message to pass both mouse coords in lParam

- Modified [Hotkey / NeXTer / 2000-08-30]
  - Shouldn't reserve unused hotkeys anymore (specifically ctrl-esc), let me
    know if it doesn't work

- Added, Modified [console, core, litestep / Headius / 2000-08-29]
  - Added console project
    - Implemented a most basic console loadmodule
    - Log messages sent to the core log dispatch will be displayed according to preferences
    - Needs a lot of work.
  - Added ILogDispatch, ILogHandler, IStepSettings interfaces to core
  - Added StandardLogDispatch to litestep
  - Modified ILitestep to support ILogDispatch retrieval


== Build 2000-08-29 ==========================================================

- Fixed [taskbar, systray2 / Headius / 2000-08-29]
  - Repaired a memory fault bug in systray2 when running with another systray going
  - Repaired a memory fault in systray2 when updating the tooltip for a new icon
  - Repaired a memory fault in taskbar when adding windows to the taskbar

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 2000-08-29]
  - Cleaned up GetRCColor() after the change to the settings caching

- Fixed [taskbar / Headius / 2000-08-29]
  - Removed a couple small memory leaks

- Modified [lsapi, desktop, desktop2, dllmgr, hookmgr, hotkey / Message / 2000-08-29]
  LSAPI:
    - Added GetResStr, and GetResStrEx to retrieve resource strings based on
     locale, GetResStrEx does a sprintf on the resource string
  The Rest:
    Moved messages to resource string tables. (So far only English string tables are done
     but other languages can easily be added now)

- Rewrite [lsapi / Headius / 2000-08-28]
  - Complete rewrite of the step.rc loading/caching internals
    - Settings were cached based on how they were requested the first time
	- Now cached once at startup, reinterpreted on request
	- Possible symptoms of the old way causing problems:
	  - Colors showing up as black, regardless of setting
	  - Strings coming back as "TRUE" or "FALSE"
	  - Integers always being 1 or 0, regardless of setting
	  - Boolean values always being TRUE or FALSE
	- Memory usage should be lower
	- May be a bit faster
	- Will lessen the effect of module order on settings validity
  - Moved exported settings functions to StepSettings.cpp

- Modified [Popup2 / NeXTer / 2000-08-28]
  - Now handles scrolling of long menus, courtesy of Sylvain Rouquette (Syl)
  - New setting: PopupScrollSpeed <int>, default is 1
  - Errata: PopupTitleBold only works in conjunction with PopupFontFace, due
    to the method for retreiving the default font

- Modified [Popup2 / NeXTer / 2000-08-27]
  - Should now handle gradients gracefully on newer builds, let me know if any
    problems occur
  - Added the settings PopupTitleBold <bool> and PopupEntryFontHeight <int>
  - Made !DynamicFolder menus display the caption of their parent
  - Fixed the vertical alignment of the text, should look better now


== Build: 2000-08-25 ==========================================================

- Modified [LSAPI, Wharf / NeXTer / 2000-08-26]
  LSAPI:
  - Added the function BOOL GetRCBoolDef(LPCTSTR szKeyName, BOOL bDefault)
    If not found, or no value specified, it returns bDefault, otherwise it
    returns the value
  Wharf:
  - Added the setting WharfAlwaysOnTop

- Fixed [wharf / Headius / 2000-08-25]
  - Rewrote the wharf types to be classes, subwharfType extends wharfType
  - Moved painting code into wharf type classes
  - Restructured paint handling to call class methods
  - Fixed the immovable wharf bug
  - Fixed (re-implemented) the right-click popup


== Build: 2000-08-24b =========================================================

- Fixed [lsapi / Headius / 2000-08-24]
  - Fixed the GetRCXXX functions to cache a special string when a value was not
    found to prevent arbitrary calls from setting their own default value into
    the cache.
  - Changed LSGetImagePath() again, to trust the results from GetRCXXX.

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 2000-08-24]
  - Changed LSGetImagePath() to work properly with the new caching system


== Build: 2000-08-24 ==========================================================

- Modified [Popup2 / NeXTer / 2000-08-24]
  - Changed the min width default to 128px

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 2000-08-23]
  - Changed LoadLSImage() so that it uses the correct path if LSImageFolder
    has been changed during a recycle.

- Added [desktop / Headius / 2000-08-23]
  - Added a dummy desktop.dll module that informs the user to use desktop2.dll
    instead
  - desktop.dll dummy will load desktop2.dll to aid upgrading older versions of
    LS

- Added [ShortCut2 / NeXTer / 2000-08-20]
  - Added the ability to define default sounds, see shortcut2.txt for details


== Build: 2000-08-17 ==========================================================

- Modified [LiteStep / NeXTer / 2000-08-17]
  - Unbroke the shell warning, sorry about that folks

- Modified [dllmgr, lsapi, popup, lswinbase / Headius / 2000-08-17]
  - Added code to force bang commands to be called from within the thread that
    registered them
  - Removed the return of HTNOWHERE from popup's hit testing, works threaded
    now
  - Modified failed class registration in Window to give it a second try
  - Modified the thread waits in dllmgr to be non-blocking, prevents lockups
    when mixing threaded and non-threaded modules

- Modified [ShortCut2, Hotkey, LSAPI, Popup2 / NeXTer / 2000-08-17]
  ShortCut2:
  - Can be refreshed with the use of the !Refresh command
  - The shortcuts now revert to the normal state before being shown
  Hotkey:
  - Now responds to the !Refresh command
  LSAPI:
  - Changed GetRCColor() back to the old way. Whatever the problem was, the fix
    broke it...
  Popup2:
  - Hidden files and folders are no longer shown
  - Hides the extensions for .bat and .pif files


== Build: 2000-08-16 ==========================================================

- Modified [lsapi / Headius / 2000-08-16]
  - Changed !RecycleStep to !Refresh, see above for information on its use
  - Added new Litestep Message LM_REFRESH
    - Module dev: Register to recieve this message using LM_REGISTERMESSAGES
          and your modules will be notified when settings have been refreshed.
	- Ideally, modules will eventually not have to be completely recycled
	  to re-load settings
	- Please support this feature in your modules. It will not break any
	  compatibility with other LS variants

- Fixed [Popup2, Lsapi / Message / 2000-08-16]
  - Fixed a bug in !PopupDynamicFolder causing it not to display
  - Added !RecycleStep which clears the step.rc cache and reloads it with out a
      hard recycle of litestep so now you can do this
      !execute [!recyclestep][!reloadmodule $litestepdir$popup2.dll] and
      changes made in the step.rc affecting only popup2.dll will take affect
      without recycling all of litestep

- Fixed [LSAPI / NeXTer / 2000-08-16]
  - The BitmapToRegion() function had the wrong conditions for flagging
    non-transparent sections
  - GetRCColor() used BGR order when LSColorBGR wasn't specified. Noone knows
    why it worked before

- Modified [ShortCut2 / NeXTer / 2000-08-15]
  - When using sounds you can now use .none for the mouseover to only get sound
    on click

- Fixed [lsapi / Headius / 2000-08-15]
  - Flaw in GetRCBool that caused it to cache the passed-in value, rather than
    the actual result of the variable
  - May or may not have caused people problems, but it was in error

== Build: 2000-08-15 ==========================================================

- Fixed [lsapi, dllmgr / Headius / 2000-08-15]
  - lsapi:
    - Modified the line caching code to use a seperate map
    - Modified FindLine to look up lines from the line cache, O(1) complexity
      instead of O(n) before
    - Fixed problem in the line/variable caches that resulted in variables
      stored case-sensitive
    - Fixed bug in TransparentBltLS where the results were not being blitted
      correctly
  - dllmgr:
    - Further improvements to module threading
      - Prevents LoadModule and QuitModule from running simultaneously
      - Prevents multiple initModuleEx from running simultaneously
      - initModuleEx calls fire in sequence

- Fixed [lsapi / Headius / 2000-08-14]
  - Added grd's code back, for testing and fixing purposes


== Build: 2000-08-14 ==========================================================

- Enhancement [lsapi / Headius / 2000-08-14]
  - Added code to improve startup/recycle times by caching variables at the time they are read
  - Backed down bitmap, icon, and transparency changes to test them further (my fault)

- Rewrite [lsapi / grd / 2000-08-14]
  - Recoded BitmapToRegion, using a combination of the old and the new versions
  - Recoded TransparentBltLS and fixed:
    a) issue that might have caused leakage or protection faults.
    b) implementation that would make TransparentBltLS cause flicker.
  - Experimental recoding of LoadLSIcon, might not be compatible with all modules

- Fixed [dllmgr / Headius / 2000-08-13]
  - Added critical section code to force module loading to be sequential
    - Modules dependent on other modules to be loaded already required this
  - Determined an issue with threading: Bang Commands are executed in a seperate
    thread from the one they are running in. This is the problem with core popup.
    - We will be exploring a couple different options for executing bang commands
      in the appropriate context.

- Created [install3 / Headius / 2000-08-11]
  - Added install3 project to be the new installation
  - Began creating installation dialogs


== Build: 2000-08-11 ==========================================================

- Enhancement [dllmgr / Headius / 2000-08-11]
  - Added code to DLLModuleManager to optionally run modules in their own threads
    - EXPERIMENTAL - please let me know what problems you have with it
    - Add "threaded" after your LoadModule lines to load modules in their own threads
      - Example: LoadModule "$LiteStepDir$\desktop2.dll" threaded
    - Module developers that wish to handle their own message pumps may do so. specifying "nopump" in the
      LoadModule line will defer to the module's pump. If there is no pump, the module will terminate immediately
    - Certain modules appear to have problems running threaded, such as core popups. We are looking into it.
    - You should see a performance improvement on multi-processor systems

- Modified [LSAPI, ShortCut2 / NeXTer / 2000-08-10]
  LSAPI:
  - Made !UnloadModule and !ReloadModule able to handle an unlimited number
    of modules. Each module should be enclosed in quotes to follow the
    recommendations for forward compatibility.
  ShortCut2:
  - Added drag'n'drop, courtesy of Sylvain Rouquette (Syl)

- Fixed [vwm2 / grd / 2000-08-07]
  - fixed the list of windows so that GXExplorer and similar programs should work

- Fixed [vwm2 / grd / 2000-08-03]
  - fixed some bugs on recycling (I think)
  - added support for sticky-windows
  - added support for changing desk on window focus


== Build: 2000-08-03 ==========================================================

- Modified [LiteStep / NeXTer / 2000-08-02]
  - Fixed a minor syntax error
  - Added code to prevent the accidental launch of multiple instances
  - Fixed the behavior of the -nostartup switch
  - Implemented support for specifying an arbitrary step.rc on the
    command line (the support was already there, but nonfunctional)

  LiteStep:
  - Changed the about box slightly.

- Modified [lsapi / Headius / 07-28-00]
  - Modified CharInStr function to use strchr rather than current search method
  - Moved all settings-related code out of lsapi into a StepSettings class
  - lsapi exports make calls on the StepSettings class
  - StepSettings encapsulates all the details of reading in step.rc format configs


== Build: 2000-07-27 ==========================================================

- Fixed [systray2 / grd / 07-26-00]
  - systray2 would crash litestep when trying to remove icons
  - systray2 default wrapping direction was up, now changed to down
  - added systray2 documentation (systray2.txt)


== Build: 2000-07-25 ==========================================================

- Fixed [Wharf / Message / 07-21-00]
  - Modules using LSWinbase would register for LM messages using hParent which
    was set to the wharf, the wharf now passes these messages on to LiteStep

- Modified [Popup2 / Message / 07-21-00]
  - Added !PopupDynamicFolder for compatiability with old Popup
  - Added folder merging capability to !DynamicFolder, !PopupDynamicFolder
    and !PopupFolder

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 07-21-00]
  - Changed the parsing system to treat token"token" as a single token, to
    make the use of older themes easier.


== Build: 2000-07-21 ==========================================================

- Fixed [LiteStep / NeXTer / 07-21-00]
  - Fixed the icon. It got corrupted by the CVS system.
  - setupVars() wasn't called soon enough on recycle, so anything that
    relied on the system variables would cause errors.


== Build: 2000-07-20 ==========================================================

- Added [systray2, popup2 / Headius / 07-17-00]
  - Added the new systray2 module, a cleaned up and updated version of grd's grdtray
    - Credit goes to grd for this one, and in record time too!
	- Very early implementation, not tested heavily
  - Added popup2 as a new popup based on Re5ource's/Johan Redestig's popup v8
    - It was decided that v8 was in better shape than 9.3x and a better candidate for integrating into LS core
	- Credit goes to Johan for his wonderful contribution to Litestep!

- Added [vwm2 / grd / 07-10-00]
  - Complete rewrite from scratch. Yet not so great but quite stable
    and most features works.

- Modified [LiteStep / Message / 06-25-00]
 - Updated the resource version information

- Modified [core, winlist, msgmgr, dllmgr, bangmgr, litestep / Headius / 06-22-2000]

  - Added LitestepAPIInit function to contain one-time init code for lsapi.dll
  - Added support for TransparentBlt to TransparentBltLS to speed up FF00FF-style
    transparency under 98 and 2k

- Fixed [ MsgMgr, WinList, LsTime2 / Message / 06-04-00]
  MsgMgr:
  - Changed from PostMessage to SendMessage in GetRevId since it was waiting
     for a return string (per Maduin)
  WinList:
  - Was registering for LM_GETREVID, didn't need to, removed
  LsTime2:
  - hParent not being set, changed to GetLitetepWnd when sending LM_REGISTERMESSAGE
     and LM_UNREGISTERMESSAGE, will now show in !about

- Modified [ hook, hookmgr, litestep / Message / 06-03-00]
  HookMgr:
  - Yet another rewrite
    - No longer uses lswinbase
    - HookMgr uses a sepereate thread now
    - Added HookCallback for modules to use when using HookMgr
    - Probably should be using WM_CALLWNDPROC or WM_CALLWNDPROCRET but these
     lock my system up everytime i try set one... =\ ( so the implementation
     is commented out for now)
  Hook:
  - Aww... yet another rewrite of hook (Back to using WM_COPYDATA, silly me
     you can't pass the pointer to the MSG struct from GetMsgProc)
  - Probably should be using WM_CALLWNDPROC or WM_CALLWNDPROCRET but these
     lock my system up everytime i try set one... =\ ( so the implementation
     is commented out for now)
  LiteStep:
  - Removed call causing hookmgr to be unloaded twice
  - Moved code that hides minimized windows  from hook.dll to litestep

- Modified [core, litestep, msgmgr / Maduin / 05-29-2000]
  - Modified the SendMessage function in IMessageManager to return a value as
      some messages depend on this.
  - Added functions GetWindowsForMessage and GetMessagesForWindow to the
      IMessageManager interface and the StandardMessageManager implementation.

- Modified [LSWinBase / NeXTer / 05-29-00]
  - The windows' class pointer wasn't initialized early enough, resulting in
    any messages originating from the WM_CREATE handler being unhandled.


== Build: 2000-05-28 ==========================================================

- Modified [Shortcut2 / NeXTer / 05-28-00]
  - When using opaque shortcut images, you can speed up loading considerably
    by adding an 'o' to the flags. This will prevent the use of regions for
    the marked shortcut.

- Fixed [lsapi, litestep / Headius / 05-28-00]
  - Added arbitrary .rc file support to the .rc caching mechanism
  - Added CacheRCFile to read/parse/cache an RC file
  - Wired CacheRCFile into SetupRC and LCOpen to fix the problems with non-step/theme.rc open
    requests failing with "File not found"
  - Reorganized start/stop/load sequence in main executable to prevent it from loading
    settings twice initially. Should speed up start time.

- Fixed [ Laspi, Desktop2 / Message / 05-27-00]
  - Fixed a memory leak in AddVariable, it was returning before deleting
    lowerName
  - Fixed a memory leak in ParseBangCommand, was not deleting tempCommand if
    (FAILED(hr))
  - Removed all references to BangMap, !About bangs not functioning at this
    time
  - Added __stdcall to bang commands for addition of BangManager
  - Added lsdebug.h in \lsapi, contains macros for debugging

- Added [bangmgr, core, lsapi, litestep / Headius / 05-26-00]
 - Added new interfaces to the core:
   * IBangManager - a bang command manager/executor
   * IBangCommand - represents an executable bang command in some form
   * ILitestep - overarching interface that contains all core services
 - Created StandardBangManager implementation of IBangManager
 - Created CallbackBangCommand implementation of IBangCommand
   * Handles callback-style bang commands, like what exists today
 - Wired StandardBangManager and CallbackBangCommand into the LSAPI bang functions:
   * AddBangCommand and AddBangCommandEx to add callback bangs
   * RemoveBangCommand to remove callback bangs
   * ParseBangCommand to parse and execute bang commands with no return values
   * Callback bangs currently do not support return values through LSAPI and Step.rc
 - Created implementation of ILitestep interface in class "Litestep"
 - Wired Litestep into existing services
   * ILitestep supports querying for default services as well as finding/registering/unregistering
     3rd-party implementations of core services
 - Added functions to populate and clear IBangManager between recycles
 - Cleaned up reference counting within StandardBangManager. Developers: AddRef before
   you pass an IBangCommand to be added.


== Build: 2000-05-26 ==========================================================

- Modified [projects, lsapi / Headius / 05-25-00]
 - Updated RC file buffers to be kept in a single map, indexed by the full path of the file
 - Added caching mechanism for *Commands in the RC files
 - Added map from file to *Command cache to allow support for arbitrary files
 - Modified SetupRC to populate caches
 - Updated LCOpen, LCClose, and the LCRead functions to use the caches, rather than
   opening a file

- Modified [LSTime2, Shortcut2, LiteStep / NeXTer / 05-25-00]
  LSTime2:
  - Added ntpfrac.cpp to avoid the irritating warnings about initialized data
  Shortcut2:
  - After a tip from blkhawk, all drawing is now done in the WM_ERASEBKGND
    handler. Should be a wee bit smother than before.
  LiteStep:
  - Added a condition that makes it possible to build under BCB. This should be
    a temporary fix until Borland releases a fix for the BSTR handling.

- Workspaces [ Desktop2, Hotkey, Litestep, Lsapi, Lstime2, shortcut2, taskbar / Message / 05-24-00]
  - Added text files to each workspace to document the step.rc, bang commands
    and variables
  - completed Desktop2, LStime2, and Lsapi - other still need to be done
  - Add post-build steps to each workspace, the text file will be copied to
    \litestep\release\docs for easy collection when releasing a build
  - Add post-build steps to Litestep workspace to copy changes.txt and
    doc\license.txt to \litestep\release

- Modified [LSAPI / Headius / 05-24-00]
  - Removing neato debug dialogs in lsapi
  - Added hierarchical caching for rc file config lines
  - Modified rc file caching to use vector entries in a map, to allow for additional files

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 05-23-00]
  - Due to popular demand, yesterdays syntax change is no longer in effect.
    GetRCColor() will assume hex for single values and dec for triplets.
  - However, GetRCInt() does, as of yesterday accept values in either octal,
    decimal or hexadecimal. (Examples: Oct: 0370, Dec: 42, Hex: 0xF0E1D2C3)
  - Fixed the problem with LSGetImagePath() where it wouldn't refresh the
    setting after updating step.rc. (Thanks to Jugg for pointing it out)

- Modified [Winlist / Message / 05-22-00]
  - Changed LM_ADDWINDOW & LM_REMOVEWINDOW to LM_WINDOWCREATED &
     LM_WINDOWDESTROYED for compatiability with changes in hook

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 05-22-00]
  - Fixed the use of vectors, since it caused a crash when built under
    BCB. Should also be marginally faster since it now also makes proper
    use of iterators.
  - Also tweaked the GetRCxxx functions a bit. Bools can now be turned off with
    either off, false and no.
  - GetRCColor() now accepts color values as either a single value or a
    triplet in the bases octal, decimal and hexadecimal. All values default to
    decimal, so if you want hex, begin the value with 0x (zero x-ray), or just
    0 (zero) for octal. (Examples: 1241245, 0x00FF8040, 255 0 0, 020 030 040)

- Fixed [lstime2, lstime2 workspace / Message / 05-21-00]
  - Added two new builds to lstime2, now have Win32 Release, Win32 Debug which ar non-ntp versions
  of lstime, and Win32 Release NTP and Win32 Debug NTP which as NTP version of lstime2
  - Setup dialog (NTP) is now displaying (code in this module could still use some
     cleaning)

- Modified [LSWinBase, Desktop2, Shortcut2 / NeXTer / 05-21-00]
  LSWinBase:
  - Added Window::init() to allow proper initialization regardless of the
    project type.
  Desktop2:
  - Removed some superflous code, and fixed some other minor issues.
  Shortcut2:
  - Had forgotten to reset the region after changing the topmost attribute.

- Fixed [lstime2 / Message / 05-20-00]
  - Fixed a bug where the last character in the theme file was being
     overwritten with a null-terminating character (\0) if the file did not
     end in a newline (\n)
  - General house cleaning in drawing routines and data validation

- Modified [Shortcut2 / NeXTer / 05-20-00]
  - !ShortcutGroupOnTopToggle now works... I had forgotten to add the actual code

- Fixed [hook / Message / 05-19-00]
  - Moved hInst into shared memory section
  - Does not return HSHELL_WINDOWCREATED/DESTROYED for cmd.exe under w2k
     (may have something to do with threading)
  - Skip catching HSHELL_TASKMAN, HSHELL_LANGUAGE, HSHELL_ACTIVATESHELLWINDOW
     they were causing lockups in win9x

- Added [Lstime2 / Message / 05-19-00]
  - Rewrote lstime to d2 format using cpp and lswinbase
  - General cleaning (its finally working now)
  - Added NTP to lstime2, right click on the clock for the menu
  - First write of the ntpclient class (setup dialog doesnt display, but Ntp syncronization works)

- Modified [hook, hookmgr, litestep / Message / 05-18-00]
  - Removed the following libs from being linked (thet weren't needed):
    uuid.lib odbc32.lib odbccp32.lib gdi32.lib winspool.lib comdlg32.lib
    ole32.lib oleaut32.lib advapi32.lib
  - Removed headers files that were not needed
  - Revised shell message handling, the shell messages are now sent only to
    litestep to be handled by msgmgr and not hookmgr
  - Removed InstallShellFilter, shell hook is now install automatically
  - GetMsgProc no longer uses WM_COPYDATA, instead the LM_SHELLMESSAGE is sent
    to hookmgr with:
    wParam: Specifies whether the message has been removed from the queue
    lParam: Pointer to an MSG structure that contains details about the message
  - Removed litestep call to hookmgr for shell messages
  - Rewrote hookmgr to handle only WM messages and to d2 format

- Modified [Shortcut2 / NeXTer / 05-17-00]
  Shortcut2:
  - Added the command !ShortcutGroupOnTopToggle.

- Added [install2 / Message / 05-15-00]
  - Added install2 which is the ls24.5 installer by jugg

- Modified [lsapi, hookmgr / Headius / 05-15-00]
  - Updated GetRCXXX functions to use the variable cache
  - Fixed problem with variable cache not flushing during recycles
  - Removed the handling of a couple shell messages to prevent Task Manager lockup problems

- Modified [Shortcut2, LSAPI / NeXTer / 05-13-00]
  Shortcut2:
  - If a shortcut is started as hidden, the resources for it aren't created
    until it is shown, substantially decreasing the time to load LS if there
    are many hidden shortcuts.
  LSAPI:
  - Tweaked the parsers a little

- Modified [lsapi / Headius / 05-12-00]
  - changed RCBuffer, ThemeBuffer, and PicBuffer to use a vector internally

- Modified [Shortcut2, SysVWM / NeXTer / 04-27-00]
  Shortcut2:
  - You now have to preceed any creation flags with '#', otherwise it'll be
    assumed that it's the command.
  SysVWM:
  - Now uses the default LoadLSImage() function to load the images, so
    specifying a path to it shouldn't cause any problems.

- Modified [Shortcut2, LSAPI / NeXTer / 04-26-00]
  Shortcut2:
  - After som thorough testing by rootrider, it should now be pretty stable.
    Currently supported bang commands are !ShortcutGroupToggle,
    !ShortcutGroupShow, !ShortcutGroupHide, !ShortcutGroupOnTop &
    !ShortcutGroupOnBottom, followed by one or more group numbers, or * to
    perform the operation on all groups.
  LSAPI:
  - Now clears all evars on recycle.

- Added [Shortcut2 / NeXTer / 04-25-00]
  - Complete rewrite from scratch, 2nd edition. The first edition
    accidentally got overwritten when I had finished it...

- Modified [LSAPI, / MrJukes / 04-25-00]
  - Replaced the BitmapToRegion() function with a streamlined version.

- Modified [General, LSAPI / NeXTer / 04-23-00]
  General:
  - Added BCB project files for all the individual DLLs.
  - Altered the core modules to use the safer prototypes for bang commands.
  LSAPI:
  - GetToken() is now an API function, but since the syntax might still change
    I don't recommend it's use just yet, unless you like living on the edge.
  - AddBangCommand() and AddBangCommandEx() will now only accept functions with
    the currect format. For ABC this is
    void BangProc(HWND sender, LPCSTR args) and for ABCE
    void BangProcEx(HWND sender, LPCSTR args, LPCSTR command).
    Please note that this does not in any way affect existing modules, it's
    strictly a source code issue.

- Modified [LSAPI, LSWinBase, Desktop2 / NeXTer / 04-21-00]
  LSAPI:
  - Fixed UniversalTokenize(): didn't clear the passed strings like it should.
  LSWinBase:
  - Added Window::handle(): returns the window handle for use outside the class.
  Desktop2:
  - The bang commands now use the recommended format of !ModuleNameFunctionName.
    Third party module creators should preferably adopt the same style to
    provide consistency

- Modified [LSWinBase, Desktop2, Hotkey / NeXTer / 04-20-00]
  LSWinBase:
  - Most of said bumps have been smoothed out. Some were actually more or less
    fatal, but that should be fixed.
  Desktop2:
  - Some minor fixes
  Hotkey:
  - Now uses the LSWinBase library

- Added [LSWinBase, Desktop2 / NeXTer / 04-19-00]
  LSWinBase:
  - First revision, it's working nicely, and I don't think we want any more
    features built in, perhaps smooth out a few bumps, but nothing major.
  Desktop2:
  - Now uses Window (in lswinbase) as base class, should simplify the process
    of writing C++ based modules somewhat

- Modified [ShortCut / NeXTer / 04-19-00]
  - Commenced conversion to C++ style, lots of work remains, but it's a start.

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 04-19-00]
  - The parsing system is rewritten from scratch.
  - Merged LCTokenize() and CommandTokenize() into a single function, both
    remain for compatibility reasons.

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 04-18-00]
  - Added LS_GWL_CLASSPOINTER to lsapi.h to simplify the creation of classbased
    modules. More along these lines are to be expected in the future.
  - Rewrote CommandParse() from scratch. CommandTokenize() will follow shortly.

- Modified [HotKey / Message / 04-18-00]
  - Module rewritten based on the framework in Desktop2.


== Build: 2000-04-17 ==========================================================

- Fixed [LSAPI / NeXTer / 04-17-00]
  - ParseBangCommand() didn't parse the information correctly if NULL was being passed
    as the argument for the bang command.
  - Also fixed a memory leak in the same function, for good measure.

- Modified [Desktop2 / NeXTer / 04-17-00]
  - The code is now almost crystal clear, if we can apply this structure
    to the other modules, much will have been acheived.

- Modified [LSAPI, Desktop2 / NeXTer / 04-17-00]
  LSAPI:
  - Merged new code for merging images in LoadLSImage(). Thank's to
    Gustav Munkby (grd) for the new code.
  - Removed some old junk.
  - Added the struct Message for passing messages from the WndProc to the
    actual message handlers.
  Desktop2:
  - Began a slight revision, to make this piece of code adhere to a "standard style"
    that can be used in the future.

- Fixed [Wharf / NeXTer / 04-16-00]
  - Fixed a bug where the wharf wouldn't hide properly when the following
    settings where used:
      AutoHideWharf
      WharfCloseOnSwitch
      ;WharfNoAnim  (swithed off)
    (Courtesy of Sergey Popov)
    Still some work to do though.
  - The message handling was radically overhauled to prepare the code for
    a convertion to proper C++ style.

- Modified [ Desktop2 / Message / 4-16-00]
  - Changed the desktop clicks to use LSExecute instead of ParseBangCommand
      This results in desktop2 not needing to parse the string before calling
      LSExecute, removed some unneeded variables and functions
      Can now do something like DesktopLeftClick cmd.exe to cause the left click
      to open a command window in WinNT etc
  - Fixed LM_GETREVID not being registered

- Fixed [ Lsapi / Message / 4-16-00]
  - Fixed popups displaying in upper left hand corner in certain cases


== Build: 2000-04-16 ==========================================================

  - Added the distinction between desktop and desktopdir in the above list.

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 04-15-00]
  - Reworked setupVars() to be more efficient, and added more predefined variables
  - The following variables are available (several of them might be inaccessible
    on your system, depending on your setup):
      litestepdir, admintools, bitbucket, commondesktopdir, commondocuments,
      commonfavorites, commonprograms, commonstartmenu, commonstartup, controls,
      cookies, desktop, desktopdir, dialup, documents, drives, favorites, fonts,
      history, internet, internetcache, nethood, network, networkanddialup,

      startup, templates.

- Fixed [ Lsapi / Message / 4-14-00 ]
  - Fixed a variable redefinition error in GetRCString
  - Uncommented _LMBANGCOMMANDA in lsapi.h, this was used in litestep.cpp for
    the purpose of allowing non-litestep modules to run litestep bang commands

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 04-14-00]
  - Added a function to strip all comments, leading and trailing whitespace from
    lines read with LCReadNextLine().
  - Made some slight changes to GetRCString() to make it more "politically correct".

- Fixed [Desktop2 / Message / 04-14-00]
  - Made right click default to !popup

- Modified [LSAPI / NeXTer / 04-14-00]
  - Some general cleaning, some code commented out until we know nothing uses it.
  - Desktop now properly resets the desktop area on resolution changes.

- Fixed [Lsapi / Message / 04-14-00]
  - Wasn't allowing modules to redefine bangs (e.g. sysvwm & lsvwm redefined !vwmleft..etc)

- Modified, Added [Desktop2 / Message / 04-13-00]
  -Reimplemented desktop clicks to use a function for setting their variables
    (Thanks MrJukes and Dem0sh for your help)
  -Added three new bang commands:
    !SetDesktopLeftClick
    !SetDesktopRightClick
    !SetDesktopMiddleClick
    These allow you to change what the mouse clicks do on the fly
    e.g. !SetDesktopLeftClick !popup x=0 y=0
  -Remove autorun functionality (was our understanding that this was flakey
    and that a 3rd party module is available that better provides this
    functionality, may be reimplemented in the future, but I see no reason
    for it to be a desktop function)
  -Did some more house cleaning (i.e. removed unused variables, added proper
    headers, proper format)

- Modified [Lsapi, Litestep / Message / 04-13-00]
  -Bang commands now stored in a stl map structure
  -Rewrote AddBangCommand, AddBangCommandEx, ParseBangCommand, RemoveBangCommand
    If use multiple bangs in a command like this !vwmleft !about, you will now need
    to use the proper method !execute [!vwmleft][!about]
  -Change BangAbout to use the new map when displaying bang commands
  -Added setupBangs called in litestep startup to register lsapi bangs
  -Fixed GetRCString on returning the full line in the step if it was all qouted
    now                   SetDesktopLeftClick !popup x=0 y=0
    will work the same as SetDesktopLeftClick "!popup x=0 y=0"
  -Added setupBangs() to litestep startup routine

- Changed [LSAPI / NeXTer / 04-13-00 ]
  - Rewrote LCTokenize() from scratch, now less than half the size of the original,
    and not obfuscated at all!

- Changed [Wharf / NeXTer / 04-12-00 ]
  - The wharf now correctly updates its position on resolution changes.

- Fixed [LSAPI / NeXTer / 04-11-00 ]
  - Fixed LSReadNextConfig() not recognizing tab characters.
  - Fixed a memory leak in LSExecuteEx().

- Fixed [Desktop2 Workspace / Message (per CoreFile) / 4-09-00 ]
  - Removed desktop2 linking to lsutil.lib


== Build: 2000-04-08 ==========================================================

- Modified/Fixed [MsgMgr / Message / 04-08-00]
  -Added GetRevID method for handling !about (NOTE: this method is likely to
    disappears when a method is implemented to return a list of hwnds for
    a given message

- Modified/Fixed [Popup / Message / 04-08-00]
  -Fixed LM_POPUP not using the coordinates passed to it via wParam and
    lParam

- Modified/Fixed [LiteStep / Message / 04-08-00]
  -Reimplemented !about, !about detailed via void GetRevId(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
    (NOTE: Uses msgmgr, implementation to change when msgmgr returns list of hwnd for given
    message)

- Modified/Fixed/Added [Popup / Message / 04-08-00]
  -Added VarExpansion to ParseBangCommand (now when a third party module, i.e.
    lsxcommand, sends a bang command to be parsed, variables will be expanded.
    e.g. previously you had to do !unloadmodule c:\litestep\modules\systray.dll,
    now you should be able to do !unloadmodule %moduledir%systray.dll, or
    something similiar)
  -Reimplemented !about, !about detailed
  -Added !about bangs, will display all registered bang commands
  -Changed About dialog to use a listbox instead of a textbox (modules will be
    unaffected by this change)
  -Changed !popup to take coordinates to display the popup (e.g. !popup x=0 y=0)

- Modified [Desktop2 / Message, noodge / 04-06-00]
  -Added the following step.rc settings:
    DesktopLeftClick <command>
    DesktopMiddleClick <command>
    DesktopRightClick <command>
    Causes click on desktop to execute the resepective command

- Modified [DllMgr, Wharf / NeXTer / 04-06-00]
  - Added direct support for modules compiled with Borland compilers
    (leading underscore)
  - Wharf now notices changes in screen resolution.

- Fixed [Desktop, Popup / Message / 04-05-00]
  - Removed some unused variables (ok, well really just commented them out until
  this build is throughly tested)
  - Did some more work on setting the desktop area, hopefully this is fixed now
  - Fixed the implementation of list::reallocate, was crashing when using
  opendynamic and showtasks


== Build: 2000-03-31 ==========================================================

- Modified [litestep / NeXTer / 03-31-2000]

== Build: 2000-03-28 ==========================================================

- Fixed? [litestep, dllmgr / Headius / 3-27-2000]
  - Added exception handling to main executable to punt exceptions during execution. Modules may act screwy because we're swallowing exceptions they are causing, but litestep shouldn't crash.
  - Improved exception handling in DLLModuleManager to unload modules that except during initialization and to ignore exceptions while quitting modules.

- Fixed [popup / NeXTer / 03-17-2000]
  - Made the folder arrow static, so that it doesn't resize with the entries
  - Added the removal (whatever) of the extension for .url files
  - Removed the initModule() function, since it's obsolete
  - Made necessary changes to allow compilation under Borland C++Builder
  - Minor cosmetic changes to the code (more comming!)

- Fixed [taskbar / Maduin / 03-15-2000]
  - Taskbar retracts its always-on-top status when an application goes full screen
  - Optimized update routines, should reduce CPU usage slightly


== Build: 2000-03-13 ==========================================================

- Modified [lsapi, workspace, popup / Message / 03-12-2000]
  - Fixed lsapi crashing with an undeclared variable (envvar was being set to NULL, and then was being
     added to the map)
  - Removed lsutil from the desktop2 dependencies (per noodge)
  - Added MessageBox warning if lsapi finds an unitialized variable, will tell the variable, and the line
  - Fixed !popupdynamicfolder not displaying folders more than 3 levels deep
  - Fixed !popupdynamicfolder using the combined paths when executing

- Modified [desktop2 / Message / 03-09-2000]
  - Removed use of LSSettings in desktop2, it was only using 7 variables from there, moved them to desktop.h
     this resulted in a 4k decrease in dll size, and SetDesktopArea seems to function correctly.


== Build: 2000-03-06 ==========================================================

- Modified [lsapi / Message / 03-05-2000]
  - Added $LiteStepDir$ which is the path to litestep. No longer need to define this in step.rc

- Fixed [lsapi / Message, NeXTer / 03-04-2000]
  - Moved stl code from lsapi.h to lsapi.cpp, otherwise it would conflict with c code
  - convert all variable names to lower case before adding them to the variable cache
  - Added deine to make the compile compatiable with version 4.0 system dll's, default was version 5.0
     and caused problems with win95/NT


== Build: 2000-03-03 ==========================================================

- Modified [popup / Message / 03-02-2000]
  - !PopupDynamicFolder can now merge folders together, | seperates paths
    Ex *Popup 	"Programs2" 	"!PopupDynamicFolder:$StartMenu$|$CommonStartMenu$"

- New code [lsapi / Message / 03-02-00]
  - Added caching to step.rc variables (i.e. $LiteStepDir$)
  - Added pre-defined variables, these variables are set by litestep
    $StartMenu$       - returns the path to the start menu
    $Programs$        - returns the path to the programs menu in the start menu
    $CommonStartMenu$ - returns the path to the common start menu in Nt/2k
    $CommonPrograms$  - returns the path to the common programs menu in the start menu in NT/2k
    $Desktop$         - returns the path to the desktop folder
    $Recent$          - returns the path to the recent folder
    $Favorites$       - returns the path to the favorites folder
    $Documents$       - returns the path to the document folder

- Modified [taskbar / Maduin / 03-01-2000]
  - Taskbar can now be docked to top or bottom screen edge
  - Added command 'TaskbarEdge <edge>' where <edge> can be 'top' or 'bottom' (default)

- Fixed [taskbar / Maduin / 02-27-2000]
  - Restoring a previously maximized task did not re-maximize it
  - Restoring a task caused the VWM to move to desktop 1
  - Right-click context menu items were not properly enabled

- Created [taskbar / Maduin / 02-25-2000]
  - The taskbar module is designed to replace the functionality of desktop's taskbar
  - All existing step.rc commands are supported
  - Start button and tray are not implemented yet, everything else should be


== Build: 2000-02-24 ==========================================================

- Modification, bugfixes [winlist, msgmgr, core, hookmgr / Headius / 2-24-2000]
  - Modified the IWindowList interface to explicitly use long values, updated clients appropriately
  - Reimplemented StandardWindowList (winlist.dll) to use STL instead of static array
  - Fixed the crashing bug in StandardMessageManager

  - Reimplemented !reloadModule and !unloadModule

- New code [desktop2 / Headius / 2-11-00]
  - New desktop2 module to replace the base desktop window from desktop.dll. Equivalent to desktop.dll with no taskbar or tray.


== Build: 2000-01-31 ==========================================================

- Bugfixes, new code [litestep, winlist, core, popup, desktop, wharf / Headius / 1-29-00]
  - Re-implemented Window List as a COM object (vtbl only; dispatch is forthcoming)
  - Modified popup, wharf, desktop, litestep to use new IWindowList interface
  - Modified litestep to load IWindowList instance from dll
  - Re-fixed popup bug, thanks to Fahim for finding the original problem
  - Re-implemented DLL Module Manager as a COM object (vtbl only; dispatch is forthcoming)
  - Modified litestep to use the new IModuleManager interface
  - Created new projects: core, winlist, dllmgr

- Bugfixes [popup / Headius / 1-22-00]
  - Transparency bug in popups under NT/W2k has been solved with a workaround.
  - Known memory leaks in popups have been eliminated.


== Build: 2000-01-21 ==========================================================

- Bugfixes, code rewrite, new code [litestep, desktop, hookmgr / Headius, Message, NeXTer]
  - Removed all hook-related code from desktop. Desktop is now no longer an integral part of core (internal) functionality.
  - New HookManager code integrated into the system allows modules to register for system messages as well as shell messages.
  - Core updated to use HookManager for hooks. Module hookmgr is loaded internally by the system, and runs in its own thread. DO NOT add hookmgr.dll to your step.rc
  - Updated lsapi to use WindowList instead of winList. No core modules have dependency on the winList array or on the LM_WINLIST message anymore. It is still provided for backward compatibility, BUT WILL BE REMOVED. We will publish the preferred replacement soon.
  - Updated lsapi to be .cpp, changes are as follows:
    - There are two supported BangCommand prototypes currently, "void BangCommand(HWND hwnd, char* args)" and "void BangCommand(HWND hwnd, char* command, char* args)". Var-len param list version is deprecated and is not likely to work anymore. We would like people to move to the 3 param version.
    - Minor typecasting fixes
  - Minor rework of core module loading sequences, some exploration into exposing service interfaces to modules.
  - Fixes to make old trayicons go away when the app is dead. Tray still seems to be broken, likely to be tossed and rewritten.
  - Fixes to prevent error messages about AppBtnClass
  - Removed the easter egg bang
  - Modified DLLModuleManager.LoadModule to allow passing parameters to start a module in its own thread, with its own message pump
  - Other stuff I'm forgetting.


== Build: 2000-01-20 ==========================================================

- Bugfixes [litestep, desktop / Headius]
  - Fixed problems with desktop.dll reporting "Could not register window" for a couple window classes.
  - Added error message to module loader to help identify problems in the future. ***NOTE*** initModule() will not be called in modules anymore. Use initModuleEx().
  - Discovered the cause of the transparent popups, but no fix yet.


== Build: 2000-01-18 ==========================================================

- Bugfixes [litestep, popup, wharf / Headius]
  - Fixes in DLLModuleManager to prevent modules that do not load from causing crash on shutdown
  - Fixes in MessageManager to prevent the possibility of empty entries in the map that might have been causing crashes
  - Fixes in popup to use the new WindowList, fixes work but not quite thread-safe yet
  - Fixes in wharf to use the new WindowList, fixes work but not quite thread-safe yet
  - Wharf.c file updated to be .cpp, minor type casting fixes


== Build: ????-??-?? ==========================================================

- Bugfixes/Code Rewrite [litestep, desktop / Headius]
  - Initial work to encapsulate window list. WindowList is now an interface to the list of windows, for apps that do not want to maintain a list themselves. Currently still uses the old winList array internally.
  - Incorporated WindowList into litestep.cpp. Legacy apps that require access to the winList array still will work, but this is temporary..apps must move away from this method.
  - Rewrite of desktop to remove window list logic. WindowList will maintain a litestep-wide list on its own now. Desktop is just another client of that list.
  - Rewrite of desktop to use a map of LSTaskButtons rather than a giant array. Memory will be saved by doing this, but STL might take that memory over.
  - Rewrite of LSTaskButton to control its own destiny. It now handles its own repainting, window activation, and other logic.
  - Task buttons will not show tooltips for now. I need to rework how this is done.
  - Desktop will be phased out in favor of new UI modules that aren't so badly written. Bugfixes will continue to be made to keep desktop around for those that need it.
  - Initial look at loading functionality as COM objects. Interfaces are starting to solidify, the next steps will be simple ones.
  - Investigation of scripting support. Scripting support will be trivial to add once core objects have been COMified.


== Build: 2000-01-16 ==========================================================

- Bugfixes [desktop, litestep / Headius]
  - Fix for bug: desktop window showing up in sysvwm. The magic dword was only being set if there was an appbar. Moved it to always be set.
  - Fix for bug: tray icons not showing up without taskbar. The icons now will show up as they did before, on the desktop according to settings.
  - Fix for bug: data store was being accessed after having been deleted. Data store is now deleted only after we are finished with it.


== Build: 2000-01-15 ==========================================================

- BugFix/Code Rewrite [litestep.cpp / Headius]
  - The data storage code in litestep.cpp was moved to a seperate class. You
    can have LS store data (generally for during a recycle) by sending
    LM_SAVEDATA with the high word of WPARAM set to the ID of the data, the low
    word set to the size, and LPARAM a pointer to the data.
  - The data can be retrieved by sending the same information in an
    LM_RESTOREDATA message, with an empty buffer. This will also remove it from
    the data store.


== Build: 2000-01-13 ==========================================================

- Update of changes since November 99 [desktop, litestep / Headius]
  - Desktop has been rewritten in C++. Portions of functionality have been split into seperate classes as much as possible. It is unlikely any class will be removable from the dll, the code is too cohesive.
    - A fix was made to desktop to repair problems with painting and taskbar size
  - Various utility classes have been created in the lsutil project for the desktop port to C++
  - Tray icon management (internal) has been split off into tray.dll
  - Litestep has had portions rewritten in C++ to better manage memory and abstract away various functional interfaces
    - DLL module management has been split off and ported
    - Message management and distribution has been split off and ported
    - The running of startup programs has been split off into a static class


== (Earlier builds not tracked) ===============================================

- BugFix [VS_6 workspace / Message]:
  - Added lsutil to the dependencies for desktop, was getting a linker error otherwise
  - Converted sources back to dos format, somehow had become saved in UNIX format.

- Feature Addition [sysvwm/vwm.c / Maduin]:
  - Can now execute commands on VWM switch:
    VWMOnSwitchToN <commands>, where N is desktop number

- BugFix [hotkey/hotkey.c / jugg]:
  - Fixed crash bug when pressing WIN key by itself.

- BugFix [VS_6 workspace / jugg]:
  - lsapi project command line had two conflicting compile options.

- Changes [lsapi/lsapi.c, litestep/litestep.c / jugg]:
  - Made the color format RGB default. Thus removing the ColorRGB command.
    However, added the command LSColorBGR for those who still want it reversed.
  - Changed all core commands to start with "LS" so now you have "LSNoShellWarning"
    replacing "ExplorerNoWarn", "LSSetAsShell" replacing "SetAsShell",
    "LSImageFolder" replacing "PixmapPath".
  - updated all modules to reflect these changes (wharf/lsvwm/sysvwm/shortcut/desktop)

- Feature Addition/Change [hotkey/hotkey.c / jugg]:
  - disabled dynamic hotkey loading of explorer start menu hotkeys by default.
    To turn them on use "HotkeyLoadExplorerKeys"
  - Changed command "WinKeyNoPopup" to "HotkeyNoWinKeyPopup"

- BugFix [lsapi/lsapi.c / visigoth]:
  - Fixed jugg's fix to ParseBangCommand()
    (NOTE: lsxcommand is fine - strlen doesn't check for null pointers)
    (ADDENDUM: Well blow me down! How about that. - jugg)

- BugFix / Change [lsapi/lsapi.c, litestep/litestep.c / jugg]:
  - Fixed ParsebangCommand function, so it removes extra whitespace. (NOTE:
    this seems to break lsxcommand when entering a !bang command that doesn't
    pass an argument. Everything else works great.)
  - Did a little clean up on litestep.c (removed code for that weird
    HideApplication thing that never worked anyway and was useless)

- Major['ish] Change [litestep/litestep.c / Ender]:
  - Done some major restructuring and pruning of litestep.c, removing some
    obsolete code and just generally making the code neater :)

- Feature Addition / BugFix [lsapi/lsapi.c / visigoth]:
  - Added CommandParse library function - parses a command and its arguments.
  - LSExecute / CommandTokenize seem to be fixed now...
  - LSExecuteEx now defaults to SW_SHOWNORMAL if passed 0 for final argument.

- BugFix [changes.txt, desktop/desktop.c, hotkey/hotkey2.c / visigoth]:
  - Fixed jugg's entry from BugFux to BugFix :P (changes.txt)
  - Merged fix from Jay Kramer (jkramer@depcoinc.com) for minimize/maximize
    problems.  Code now checks for system menu before doing so (desktop.c)
  - Fixed compiler warning: LSExecute not declared (hotkey2.c)

- BugFix [sysvwm\vwm.c / jugg]:
  - Fixed erroneous refresh of sysvwm when using the autohide feature
    without "VWMAutoHideFix" set.
  - Fixed autohide bug, when the vwm was docked to two sides of the screen,
    the vwm would appear when mouse was moved to either side.

- BugFix [lsapi.c / jugg]:
  - Fixed CommandTokenize function so that you no longer are forced to place
    all commands completely in quotation marks or brackets.

- Bugfix [litestep.c / Maduin]:
  - Fixed the Loadmodule code so that the modules get passed the correct
    Instance now. Thanks to MrJukes for spotting this.

- Bugfix [shortcut.h / murphy]:
   - Added char extra_group[10]; to struct shortcutType. Was made to
     make shortcut.c compile.

- Feature Addition [desktop.c / (e)]:
   - Added code by Jay Kramer (jkramer@depcoinc.com)
     min/max click update for start bar (new explorer functionality)

- Feature Addition / Bugfix [vwm.c / (e)]:
   - Added VWMAutohideFix. This makes the autohide VWM only appear
     when the mouse hovers in the actual VWM area (as opposed to the
     entire screen edge).

- Feature Addition [Shortcut.c / Ender]:
   - Semi-working Shortcut Multiple Mastergroups. Some strange behavior I
     can't figure out, someone fix it :P
     [Method: #3M{2,5}T  : Master for group's 3, 2 AND 5]
